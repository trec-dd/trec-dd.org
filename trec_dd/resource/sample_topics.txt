					<text>Well you can&amp;apos;t beat this deal. Not bad for a few minutes of your time.  
  
I&amp;apos;ll even provide a review you can just copy &amp;apos;n paste after you buy the book.  
  
Verified Amazon review gets you $10+.99 cent book purchase = $10.99 sent to
your PayPal, fees covered by me. Payment sent after review is posted on
Amazon.  
  
I&amp;apos;m paying extra to attract people who know what they are doing and have a
good Amazon account. PM and I&amp;apos;ll send details. I&amp;apos;d like to build up m iTrader
score, too, so rest assured you will be paid!  
  
NOTE: DO NOT PM UNLESS YOU ARE SERIOUS AND READY TO GO. I only need about 5
reviews at first.

%gt; I used to do reviews of books on a niche authority site. Whenever a new book
was published I made a deal with either the author or publishing company to
provide me with 10 copies that I would be able to sell on my site or on ebay.
Making money from Amazon with books is not a big profit maker unless you can
sell hundreds of books per item.</text>

%gt; Still too cheap  
Plus your book is too cheap  
mimimum price should be $2.99  
for you to make a profit  
Then pay at least $5 a review, other wise you will get cheap badly written
reviews  
  
Basically if you cant afford $80 dollars for your business, then you are
doomed to failure  
  
Cheaper option plus you should do this too  
get a Facebook ads voucher $5  
and promote your kindle on fb

%gt;

%gt; No special terms - I pay you first (PayPal), you download the eBook, I send
you the review, and you post it. That&amp;apos;s it.
![](https://static.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/images/smilies/smile.png) I
pay 6 USD for a review - the eBook was 0.99 USD, but now it&amp;apos;s back to 2.99

I project manage my client&amp;apos;s Amazon Kindle publishing account. From deciding
on what niches to write titles in to hiring people to making sure we sell well
, I&amp;apos;m responsible for the whole business cycle. I&amp;apos;m looking for someone who
has excellent expertise in Amazon Kindle SEO and optimization. The ideal
candidate knows almost everything there is to know about getting a book (kdp
or createspace version) the highest possible sales ranking, select the right
kind of keywords, ensure that the product page is optimized, work with
reviewers in making sure the content for reviews are optimized and run sales
experiments (such as dual purchases or search find purchases whenever needed).
In short I am looking for an Amazon Kindle whiz who knows all those neat
tricks to make a book&amp;apos;s sales soar.  
  
The business is fairly new, but has enjoyed some good success organically,
with limited sales efforts on our part. We&amp;apos;re now looking to grow and I think
the Amazon sales expert&amp;apos;s role is a very crucial part of this growth. If you
are someone who can work with us and show us some good results, I&amp;apos;d be
interested in hearing from you.

reviews for you. They just need to be posted.  
  
I&amp;apos;ll only accept &amp;quot;aged&amp;quot; accounts from real members. Of course you may use fake
accounts but none solely created for my purpose!  
  
I would like to pay **$15 per review** (around 150-200 words) plus **$4 per
purchase**. Yes, I need you to actually buy the product.  
  
_Yes, I know that I can get a lot of reviews for $15/$19 but I don&amp;apos;t want
crap. I want quality. The only thing that matters is that the review &amp;quot;sticks&amp;quot;.
I know there is no guarantee for this but I expect you to do your best._  
  
You may contact me via PM or answer within this thread.  
  
  
Thanks in advance,  
antagonist  
  
  
PS: I&amp;apos;ve got a feeling that there will be many lazy people answering without
having read at least the headline so I&amp;apos;ll make this clear for you: I need
GERMAN Amazon reviews. With the .DE TLD, you know?
![](https://static.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/images/smilies/wink.png)  
  
PPS: You may of course contact me in German as I&amp;apos;m from Germany. That would be
a great way to prove you&amp;apos;re capable of doing what I&amp;apos;m asking for.  
  
PPPS: If you are not able to provide this kind of service yourself but you
know somebody who can - refer me to your contact and I&amp;apos;ll pay you $10 when I
make a deal with him or her.

---------POST 1---------

%gt; I am looking for people with aged Amazon accounts, that live in Germany and
speak fluent German. I need all reviews left in German and not copy/paste with
google translate or anything similar. Your account needs to be aged 6+ months,
and have multiple purchases, and reviews over the course of the past 6 months.
I am looking for multiple accounts so if you have an account and know someone
else I&amp;apos;d like to speak with them as well. You can PM me or skype me, my skype
details are below my name.  
  
This is a paying gig, so don&amp;apos;t worry.

%gt; Hi, I have a legit 250 page paperback on amazon.com about LinkedIn and I
need to post more 5 star reviews to help with sales. For me, the problem has
been finding a good posting service. You see, you need someone experienced
with amazon.com, because to post a review you need to have bought something
there, physical or digital, before. I have been paying some people on fiverr
to help. I&amp;apos;d like to find more help. Ideas? Please message me. Thanks.

%gt; You&amp;apos;ll shoot yourself in the foot buying all 5 star reviews.  
  
People don&amp;apos;t give them as much credence as they used to, and they are usually
able to see right through them. Take a look at any bestseller&amp;apos;s list. Not one
of them contain books with all 5 star reviews. The best selling books have
strongly polarized reviews, with plenty of 1 stars. Sometimes, up to half as
many 1 stars as five stars.  
  
If your book is good, just give out review copies to interested individuals
and let the reviews come in organically. You are rolling the dice with your
credibility by buying reviews.  </text>

					<text>Secondly, Amazon is cracking down on fake reviews. Not mass purchasing. You
can just Google for this info and see the fact. Nevertheless fake reviews
provider will still have a way to overcome this else they will be out of

In conclusion, there is no fact stating that Amazon is against mass purchasing

					<text>**There are so many books that I know some of you are putting out there, and the fake reviews are VERY obvious. 5 star reviews from people who obviously barely speak/understand English? Really? Do you really think these reviews are fooling anyone?   
**  
Then I download the 4 or 5 star rated book...and it&amp;apos;s horrible. Typos
everywhere, bad, even dangerous info, etc.  
  
Let me let those of you who need it in on a little secret: when a book has 4x
the number of 5 star reviews than it does 1 star reviews, and little to no 4
or 3 star reviews, it&amp;apos;s an obvious fake.

					<text>Let&amp;apos;s be honest, how many people really alert the authorities (or anyone for that matter) that they got an email for a bigger dick? People that don&amp;apos;t use the internet that often get annoyed - but it won&amp;apos;t go nowhere. People who do use the internet often don&amp;apos;t remember shit from shinolah as far as what they clicked and what they agreed too, so they are likely to ignore/delete the unwanted messages. I for one get hundreds of spam email/day on one of my email accounts. I scan them over long enough to make sure I didn&amp;apos;t miss anything important, then delete them. Its like getting direct marketing mats in your mailbox. You didn&amp;apos;t ask for it, but somewhere along (a very long line) you agreed to receive stuff. Are you going to contact you local post office, legislator or city official to complain? Probably not. Even if you DID, they&amp;apos;ll probably smile and nod. Bottom line, scraping isn&amp;apos;t as big an issue as what and how you use what you get.</text>

You will eventually get your IP shutdown from Gmail, AOL, Hotmail, and will all go to spam. I remember when I first started I blasted 10k emails, 1ce a day for a week straight. Made about 4k but then my e-mail server went down the drain. Everything was either returned or lost.. My host couldn&amp;apos;t figure it out and requested for us to be removed by the ISP</text>

					<text>Can you make money off spam? As coreygeer said you could set up an
autoresponder which replys to the &amp;quot;reply-to&amp;quot; email address the spammer used.
The interesting thing here is that spammers usually use other peoples email
addresses in the reply-to field so your autoresponse may actually get through
to people.  
  
You could also use spam emails as content for spam sites. Set up a fake yahoo
account, sign up to lots of shit, have script log into account and scrape
emails and insert keywords. Kind of long winded when you can spin or use
markov but it answers the questions right ![](https://static.blackhatworld.com

					<text>Me and a partner of mine are looking for someone who has skills of sending

the payment can be done weekly via paypal, bank transfer or western union. We
are going to be three people in total (the two of us + you) and we are going
to split profits evenly.  
  
Me and my partner will provide a good volume of valid e-mails and a tested
method which was proved to make great money on a small scale! However we don&amp;apos;t
have the skills to move onto something bigger and send a bigger volume of
e-mails so here is where we need YOU!  
  
If you know how to send mass e-mails, have all the tools necessary and are

					<text> But, I&amp;apos;m going to offer you a few tips that hopefully will help you: 1. Don&amp;apos;t scream &amp;quot;Sign Up Now&amp;quot; in your emails. Be precise and to the point and tell what they would be signing up for instead of the email just being 100% hype. 2. How are you presenting the offer? Part of the sales process are visuals and within it&amp;apos;self is accountable for a good amount of the sales made by any affiliate or service provider. Design an eye catching email that will &amp;quot;Instantly&amp;quot; grab their attention where they have to keep reading or they feel the need to click on the link contained within to find out more. MadMimi has a great software for building custom emails and also offers affordable rates for mass email sending. 3. Who are you sending them to? Who&amp;apos;s your audience and who is receiving these emails? Perhaps the only reason your earnings are low if you&amp;apos;ve done the two previous steps that I stated above. Are you sending to opt-ins? Did you buy the emails or did you harvest them yourself? If you were to have the email addresses to 10,000 people who were interested in your offer, you&amp;apos;d earn a lot more than $4 so try to optimize your email list for better conversions. I hope this helps and if you need any additional help or information, just send me a Private Message. Good luck!

					<text>Make an ebook on for example &amp;quot;10 Tips on finding your perfect partner and dating them&amp;quot; make them sign up to get the book. Now start pumping that link out there for the sign up, and before you know a targeted list will start to form in front of your eyes. Now that is something that sounds like email marketing with a plan. Having a good plan is the only way you will be succesful. If you could get rich by randomly spamming 10 000 people with a 1 line offer that smells dodgy from miles away, the world would have a lot more millionaires. Try and make a business plan where you bring at least a little value to the receiver (or at least get him to perceive that what you are offering is of value)</text>

%gt; I would suggest getting a VPS and try not to go with big US hosting
companies like Hostgator or GoDaddy as they will shut you down for spam abuse.
Search around for VPS in the Netherlands or in Asia. If you want to stick with
US webhosting try to sign up with smaller companies</text>

					<text>If the list is scraped and if you have not removed spam traps and all other threats from the list none of your emails will reach inbox. All your domains and IP&amp;apos;s will be blacklisted in a day. Perhaps to check bounces you will have to send those mails and you have no other go..

					<text>Mail sent from a trusted SMTP (Example: smtp.gmail.com) is more likely to get through spam filters at the receiving inbox. If an SMTP has been abused, that SMTP would become blacklisted by the likes of hotmail, gmail etc. Any mail sent from a blacklisted SMTP is unlikely to get through spam filters. You can send emails from your computer without the use of an SMTP, you can use port 25. I suggest you read this first as most email clients block port 25 for this reason. Cant put links yet, but add this to the end of wiki&amp;apos;s domain without quotes, &amp;quot;/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques&amp;quot; You may find sendblaster 2. sendblaster.com/ They have a recommended SMTP that you can use. However you have to pay per email. There ARE other members of this forum that know more about this subject then I, but they aren&amp;apos;t here yet. BTW, when choosing text font colour, please consider contrast.</text>
