		<topic name="Return of Klimt paintings to Maria Altmann" id="dd17-1" num_of_subtopics="3">
			<description>Find information about the artwork by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt that was stolen by Nazis from its Austrian owners and subsequently returned to the rightful heir, Maria Altmann.</description>
			<narrative>This topic follows developments in the case of six specific paintings stolen by the Nazis during WWII.  The stolen paintings were given to a relative of the artist (Gustav Klimt), who in turn gave them to the Austrian government. Maria Altmann, heir of the original owners and in her 90s and living in California, was able to reclaim the art after a lengthy battle in U.S. and Austrian courts.   Information about Ms. Altmann’s legal pursuit, which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court; the resistance by the Austrian Government to turning over the paintings; and the final agreement by both sides to an arbitrated settlement is all relevant.  I was further interested in the reasons for the subsequent sale of the paintings by Ms. Altmann. Only the six paintings that comprised the Altmann case are relevant; work by other artists and other work by Klimt that had been confiscated by the Nazis is not relevant.</narrative>

					<text><![CDATA[Galerie St. Etienne is presenting an oil by Gustav Klimt with a story behind it. The model for the sweetly plaintive ''Portrait of a Lady Facing Front'' (1898-99) is thought to be Klimt's patron and maybe lover, Adele Bloch-Bauer. The work was stolen from her family by the Nazis, but recouped by Klimt's illegitimate son, himself a Nazi. He gave it to the Austrian National Gallery, which recently restored it to the family.]]></text>

			<description>Who outed covert CIA operative Valerie Plame?</description>
			<narrative>This topic asks who identified undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame to newspaper columnist Robert Novak, who published her name and Agency association in his column.  All references to possible sources of the information given to Mr. Novak is relevant, including both journalists and officials within the Bush administration.  Ultimately, Novak’s sources were identified as Richard Armitage, a State Dept. deputy and White House official Karl Rove.   The indictment of Scooter Libby, VP Cheney’s chief of staff is relevant.  Libby was ultimately convicted of perjury in his testimony to a grand jury and to FBI investigators regarding how he learned Ms. Plame’s identity and to whom he divulged it.  The entire scenario played out over 2-plus years while a special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, pursued the source(s) of the leak.   Information about the underlying reasons for the leak, allegedly to justify a flawed rationale for the Iraq invasion; and legal battles over freedom of the press and subpoenas for journalists’ testimony and notes, are not relevant.</narrative>

In was in that conversation that Mr. Rove first learned the name of the C.I.A. officer from Mr. Novak, according to lawyers in the case.

			<description>Why was the Tribeca Film Festival started and who are the founders?</description>
			<narrative>I am interested in the origins of the Tribeca Film Festival and the identities of the founders.  Only information on the film festival is relevant.  Information on Tribeca Enterprises, also founded by de Niro, Rosenthal, and Hatkoff, and its branded entertainment and media companies, was not relevant.  Snippets that identified de Niro, Rosenthal, and/or Hatkoff as "founders" were judged key.  Snippets that alluded to the founders using terms such as "brainchild" were judged as highly relevant.  Snippets that specifically stated that the festival was started to revitalize Lower Manhattan after 9/11 were key.  Snippets that simply tied the start of the festival to 9/11 without specifying an economic cause were judged as relevant.  Allusions to an economic reason for the festival were judged as highly relevant.</narrative>

The festival was as noteworthy for the mood of the event as for the films it screened, and especially for the buoyant spirit of its family street festival, an enormous party along six blocks of Greenwich Street.]]></text>

(Mr. Scarlet said that when he first heard about their project he was equally skeptical: ''I had always wanted to create a product called Festicide, which would prevent the weed-like growth of new film festivals.'') Sept. 11 changed all that, suddenly creating a need for civic-boosting, arts-enhancing, tourism-friendly events. ''There were still emergency vehicles on the street,'' Mr. Hatkoff recalls. ''They were working on the site; you could still smell the burning rubber in the air; no one had been out on the street in any kind of celebratory way; and here is Jane saying, 'Let's put on a film festival!'

			<description>Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, was convicted of corruption and misuse of power.</description>
			<narrative>This topic is about how Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was accused of misdeeds and dismissed from her office twice. Finally, one court convicted her of money laundering, but dropped the penalty, while another convicted her of corruption and misuse of power and sentenced her to five years in prison. She fled the country, however, spent nine years in self-imposed exile, and then returned to run in an election, never serving any jail time.</narrative>

			<description>What is a dwarf planet and which celestial bodies are considered dwarf planets?</description>
			<narrative>I wanted to learn the definitions of planets and dwarf planets, and I wanted to learn which celestial bodies became classified as dwarf planets.  The specific definitions were relevant and I judged them based on their specificity.  Any discussion of Pluto being "downgraded" to a dwarf planet also was relevant as was information on Eris/Xena and Ceres being reclassified as dwarf planets.  Specific information on the International Astronomical Union's definition was key; debate leading up to the issuance of the definition was highly relevant.  Data on a museum and planetarium's demotion of Pluto prior to the release of the officially recognized definition of dwarf planets was judged highly relevant.  Information on brown, red, and white dwarfs was not relevant.  General information on the discovery of the Kuiper Belt and "planet-like" bodies found there was not relevant.  A gray area was an asteroid named Eros; I never saw any information that indicated that "Eros" was an alternate spelling for "Eris," one of the dwarf planets, and so references to "Eros" were not relevant.</narrative>

					<text><![CDATA[The discovery of 2003 UB313 has intensified a debate over the definition of a planet, which has swirled about Pluto since the late 1990's. Pluto is by far the smallest of the nine planets, and 2003 UB313, while larger than Pluto, is still smaller than Earth's moon. According to one definition, a planet has to gravitationally dominate its surroundings. That would exclude both Pluto and 2003 UB313. Some astronomers contend that any object in the solar system large enough that gravity has shaped it into a sphere should be called a planet. But that would also add quite a few asteroids and other Kuiper Belt objects. Another possibility is to arbitrarily call anything larger than Pluto a planet.]]></text>

Pluto was discovered on Feb. 18, 1930, by Clyde W. Tombaugh, and astronomers initially estimated it to be as large as Earth. They have since learned it is much smaller, smaller than Earth's Moon. But Pluto continued to be called a planet, because there was nothing else to call it. Then, in 1992, astronomers found the first Kuiper Belt object.

That debate boils down to what is a planet and what is not, a seemingly straightforward concept with no precise definition.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[When a Caltech astronomer, Michael Brown, announced last year that his team had found a distant object three-fourths the size of Pluto orbiting the Sun, he declined to call it a planet, and he even suggested that Pluto should not be considered a planet either. There was, he said, just no good scientific rationale for considering either of those distant bodies in the same league as the eight indisputable planets that circle the Sun at closer range. Now Dr. Brown has found something orbiting the Sun that's bigger than Pluto and even farther away. He's changed his mind and proposed that Pluto keep its designation, and that the new object, an extremely big lump of ice and rock, should also be deemed a planet. There is still no good scientific rationale for the judgment, he admitted, but this is a case where habit -- 75 years of calling Pluto a planet -- should trump any scientific definition.]]></text>

Instead, the Rose Center decided it was more like the icy bodies orbiting in the Kuiper Belt, well beyond Neptune.]]></text>

In recent years, some scientists have suggested that the rocky body, with its odd orbit and small size, should be classified as an asteroid or a runaway moon of a larger planet like Neptune. "It's a planet," Dr. Stern said. "It's round, it has a satellite, and it has an atmosphere. It fulfills all the requirements."]]></text>

As time has gone on, it has become increasingly apparent that such is the case. Pluto is by no means a major planet in the sense that Neptune and the other giant planets are; it does not even compare to the terrestrial planets, particularly when one considers that it is in a vastly different environment. We really don't know what Pluto is. It is not out of the question that Pluto and its satellite are some giant double comet, essentially inactive at their great distance from the sun. To call Pluto an asteroid would make use of a convenient catch-all category that already includes many other highly unusual objects whose nature and origin are not at all clear.]]></text>

			<description>What caused the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?</description>
			<narrative>This topic examines the multi-faceted reasons for the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.  One sub-topic addressed the varying perspectives of the East European members, including impetuses for national autonomy, economic revival, and political freedom.  The second sub-topic considered the Soviet reaction to those developments.   While Mikhail Gorbachev had encouraged the European Pact members to loosen economic and political constraints within their countries, he did not foresee or want the dissolution of the military alliance.  Overtaken by rapid evolution of events, including the fall of the Berlin wall, the reunification of Germany, and the prospect of Pact members becoming part of NATO, the Soviet Union acceded to the inevitable.  Warsaw Pact member states formally ended their multi-national alliance on March 31, 1991. Developments in Eastern Europe beyond those affecting the status of the Warsaw Pact, simultaneous negotiations between NATO and the Pact for conventional arms reduction, Gorbachev’s reform movement within the USSR, or reactions to any of these developments by the U.S. or Western Europe were not relevant.</narrative>

					<text><![CDATA[The commandos have been in ground combat only once, in the 1983 invasion of Grenada. According to classified military briefings - and contrary to the view promoted by the Reagan Administration of a highly successful military operation - pre-invasion intelligence in Grenada was poor. There were breakdowns in communication equipment and the multiple military commands involved created much confusion. These factors contributed to the initial failure of the commandos' assault on Richmond Hill Prison, where political prisoners were being held. And for two days, commandos could not find some of the American medical students on the island - a blunder that, if seized upon by Cuban forces, could have resulted in massive hostage-taking or casualties. Four frogmen drowned during a pre-invasion assault. A special helicopter unit was stationed nearby on Barbados, but it was not used.]]></text>

			<narrative>Dental implants, a permanent alternative to dentures or bridges, have increased in popularity since introduction in the late 1980s.  The biggest problem with them has been that they are quite expensive. There was an issue with them at one time related to a drug for osteoporosis and bone loss that caused death of bone in the jaw as a side effect. Patients worried because experts said that invasive procedures like dental implants could set off this bone loss.</narrative>

Panel experts estimated that from 1983 to 1987, implants increased fourfold, to 30,000 a year, adding that they expected 300,000 implants to be performed annually by 1992.]]></text>

A significant portion of implants were known to loosen in as little as five years, and the surgery has been a last alternative for those who had lost all their natural teeth and, with them, the means to support bridgework. Longer 'Survival' Time That appears to be changing, however. The ''survival'' time for implants has been improving in recent years, several studies have shown. In 1978, for example, a type of implant was considered successful if at least 75 percent of the implants survived 5 years. The current standard is 85 to 90 percent of implants must endure for more than 10 years.]]></text>

If the bone could be grown back, it might be possible to implant new, artificial teeth rooted in the bone.

But over the last two months, the situation here, 350 miles southeast of Puerto Rico, has taken a sharp turn again for the worse. On June 25, Soufriere began spewing a river of ash, rock and gas, heated to temperatures as high as 900 degrees Fahrenheit, down its slopes at speeds of more than 100 miles an hour. Those lethal ''pyroclastic flows,'' as volcanologists call them, left at least 10 people dead and forced the abandonment of several villages. Another 9 people are missing and presumed buried under volcanic debris. Then, on July 31, after a respite that left people here hoping the worst was over, a new and even more dangerous cycle began. Since then, the volcano has been erupting almost every 12 hours.]]></text>

A better option for those with American relatives, he suggested, might be to apply for a green card through a relative's sponsorship and ride out the 12- to-20-year wait in Britain, returning when permanent residency comes through. Though 3,500 island residents moved to Britain by the late 1990's, England was not quick to open the door, Ms. Weekes and others pointed out. Eventually evacuees from Montserrat were granted special aid and residency waivers for access to national health care and other benefits in England, but only for people who went directly to Britain from Montserrat. Citizens of British overseas territories were not automatically entitled to British residency until 2002. The Monserratians in the United States do not automatically have British passports. Sarah Crichton, a spokeswoman at the British consulate in New York, said those special waivers were up for review next year, and she could not say whether they would apply to islanders who had been ''temporarily'' living in the United States. She suggested, however, that any Montserratian rendered homeless by the unexpected Homeland Security ruling would get a sympathetic hearing from British authorities.]]></text>

Since it was unsafe to send them back after their visitors' visas expired, the United States granted the Montserratians ''temporary protected status,'' renewed year by year so they could legally stay and work until the worst was over. Now, in a startling twist that reflects a major change in immigration politics, the Department of Homeland Security is ordering the 292 Montserratians to leave by the end of February -- not because it is safe to go home again, but because it is not going to be safe anytime soon. ''The volcanic activity causing the environmental disaster in Montserrat is not likely to cease in the foreseeable future,'' Homeland Security officials explained in a June 25 notice ending Montserratians' temporary protected status effective Feb. 27, 2005. ''Therefore it no longer constitutes a temporary disruption of living conditions that temporarily prevents Montserrat from adequately handling the return of its nationals.'' The decision has stunned islanders who rebuilt their lives in America from scratch. ''It's devastating,'' said Sarah Ryner, 59, a public health nurse supervisor who lost her home and career in the volcanic aftermath and now works night shifts at a New Jersey hospital. ''I'm just frozen, and my children are the same. We are saying: What can we do? Where can we go?'']]></text>

There is also growing evidence that eggs, rather than being a dietary bete noir, can be organically produced to make them even more of a nutritional boon than they are. Nor can the vogue for high-protein dieting in America be discounted. At 80 calories an egg, with 6 grams of protein, not to mention iron and vitamins A, D, E and K, the egg is nature's very own Slim Fast. Last year, supermarket egg sales rose by 20 percent. The tide has turned. Eggs are back. In addition to their nutritional rehabilitation, their culinary star is on the rise again, too. In the country's finest restaurants, they are being coddled into silken, savory custards, like the compote of white truffles served at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, Calif.

					<text><![CDATA[Cholesterol in the diet became a health issue after studies of thousands of people in a dozen countries showed a direct link between the amount of cholesterol in the blood and the risk of developing and dying of coronary heart disease. However, subsequent research revealed two main influences on blood cholesterol: the amount of saturated fat in the diet and heredity. Dietary cholesterol is only weakly associated with coronary risk. For the average American, eating an additional 200 milligrams of cholesterol a day (about the amount in one egg) raises blood cholesterol about 3 milligrams, which in turn raises the risk of coronary disease by 6 percent. But people are not averages. There are several ways in which the body can compensate for an increase in dietary cholesterol. In most people, cholesterol production in the liver is reduced in direct proportion to the amount consumed. In addition, excretion of cholesterol through the production of bile acids often rises as more cholesterol is eaten. And when a lot of cholesterol is consumed at once, absorption through the digestive tract commonly drops. Genetically, people fall into three groups: those who are very sensitive to dietary cholesterol and whose blood levels rise significantly when they eat more cholesterol; those who are insensitive and whose blood levels remain the same or even fall when more cholesterol is consumed, and those in between. Researchers at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N. C., recently identified a common genetic mutation that makes people resistant to dietary cholesterol, allowing them to eat 1,000 milligrams a day without raising their blood levels. To add to the confusion, in healthy adults, daily egg consumption has been shown to raise blood levels of the so-called good cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol, which helps to keep blood vessels free of cholesterol deposits. Who Should Worry]]></text>

The egg industry took in about $3.5 billion in revenue last year, and consumption in the United States has gone up steadily in the last few years, according to the American Egg Board. The rate is now 260 eggs per person a year, up from 234 in 1991, but still down from the high of 402 in 1945. The recent rise can be attributed in part to a revision by the American Heart Association in its recommended intake of egg yolks -- it now allows for up to four a week as a part of a healthy diet, instead of three, because studies have shown that they are slightly lower in cholesterol than previously thought.]]></text>

This comes to 5,300 milligrams of cholesterol a day, 5,000 more than what is recommended for ordinary Americans. Yet the man's cholesterol level is a reasonable 200 milligrams (per 100 milliliters of blood serum) and he has no clinical evidence of serious atherosclerosis.

But individual responses to cholesterol in food vary so greatly that some people show virtually no effect. And in any event, the primary culprit is not cholesterol in the diet but saturated fat in the diet: eating foods like red meat, which are high in saturated fat, has been shown to affect cholesterol levels in the blood powerfully. Eating eggs, which are high in cholesterol, concerns many nutritional experts far less. It turns out that the body makes its own cholesterol, which is an essential component of cell membranes and a key ingredient in hormone manufacture. So there is a balancing act. The more cholesterol you eat, the less your body makes. It's not a perfect balance: for some people the cholesterol level will rise if they eat more, said Dr. Ronald M. Krauss, the head of the department of molecular and nuclear medicine at the Donner Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[A large new study has suggested that eating more vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables may help prevent premature death from heart disease and other ailments. The study, conducted among more than 11,000 Americans, indicated that consuming ample amounts of vitamin C in foods and supplements may lower death rates, especially the coronary death rate among men. Although the study, like others before it, does not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin C intake and lower rates of disease and death, its findings add to fast-mounting evidence that this and other nutrients can protect against such major killers as heart disease and cancer. The benefits are most pronounced when the nutrients are consumed in amounts above those needed to prevent nutritional deficiencies. The nutrients act as antioxidants, which block the damaging effects of highly reactive forms of oxygen on compounds in the body.]]></text>

Raw tomatoes contain lycopene, too, but cooking them makes it easier to absorb. Tomato sauce and tomato juice are also loaded with the compound. According to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, people who eat a lot of tomato-based foods can reduce their risk of developing cancer by 40 percent.

Based on an exhaustive review of worldwide research, in 1997 the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research estimated that ''diets high in vegetables and fruits (more than 14 ounces a day) could prevent at least 20 percent of all cancer incidence.'' For cancer prevention, the institute recommends 5 to 10 servings a day of vegetables and fruits. Foods especially rich in cancer-protective chemicals include the onion family, cabbage-family vegetables (including broccoli, cauliflower, bok choy, kale and brussels sprouts), dried beans and peas, tomatoes, deep yellow-orange vegetables and fruits (like sweet potatoes, cantaloupe and winter squash), citrus fruits, blueberries and dried fruits like prunes and raisins.

The researchers, who looked at 10 kinds of onions as well as shallots, found broad differences in the concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids, compounds that can help reduce the risk of medical problems like heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Their report appears in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. There is a wrinkle, however. The more powerful the concentration of the compounds in onions, the more powerful the flavor -- and the smell. So there could be some social fallout.

In a 1998 study, Harvard scientists found that drinking one cup of tea daily lowers the risk of heart attack by 44 percent and that it reduces the risk of esophageal, stomach and kidney cancers. And a study in Japan suggests that female patients who drank more than 10 cups a day lived 6.5 years longer, and male patients 4.5 years longer. Can this be true? Can we really gulp down 3 to 10 cups of tea a day and be safe from the biggest killers in the modern world? According to scientists, the polyphenols in green tea are antioxidants 20 times more powerful than Vitamin E and 200 times more than Vitamin C. Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg, professor of nutrition at Tufts, cites a study at Boston University that ''showed better vascular function in black-tea drinkers with heart disease than those who didn't drink it,'' and says, ''The only double-blind study of its kind showed that while smoking damages DNA, green-tea drinkers have less-damaged DNA. It doesn't mean you can smoke if you drink tea, but it does show improvement.'']]></text>

The disease, macular degeneration, destroys the central portion of the retina, the light-gathering cells at the back of the eye. Among people who already have significant yellowish deposits accumulating at the back of their eyes -- the hallmark of the disease -- the supplements cut their risk of vision loss by one-fifth. ''This is keeping them with good vision,'' said Dr. Frederick Ferris, director of clinical research at the National Eye Institute, which sponsored the study. ''We were surprised at how effective it is, given it is just supplements.'' The supplements -- a combination of zinc and the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene -- did not appear to slow the early stages of the disease, when the yellowish deposits develop, but that is a normal part of aging and is not necessarily of concern, Dr. Ferris said.

					<text><![CDATA[Not so long ago, antioxidant vitamins were hailed as nature's own weapons against chronic illness, powerful antidotes to horrid diets and failed exercise plans. A parade of observational studies showed that people who consumed large amounts of vitamins C and E and beta carotene were usually healthier than those who ingested comparatively little. Almost overnight, it seemed, millions of consumers morphed into fervid pill poppers, and antioxidants were dolloped into an ever expanding variety of foods. But recent and more rigorous research suggests that this silver bullet missed its mark. Most long-term prospective trials have shown that using antioxidant vitamin supplements does not prevent heart disease or cancer, with the possible exception of prostate cancer. In a study published last month in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers in Europe analyzed data from 68 large trials in which more than 232,000 adults were given antioxidant supplements.]]></text>

Buried in the report was the suggestion that a good diet may reduce the risk of chronic disease: a diet of nutrients from food, not pills. The study set out to determine whether the antioxidants vitamin E and beta carotene, which converts in the body to vitamin A, reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. The subjects were an unhealthy population of 29,000 Finnish men over 50 with many risk factors: they were generally overweight, had used tobacco heavily and for long periods, and had high cholesterol levels and high intakes of fat and alcohol.

This is a pretty unrealistic position since most of us don't eat a balanced diet and certainly don't eat enough fruits and vegetables. Bowing to reality, the official position has been modified enough to include the advice that a one-a-day multivitamin can do no harm and may be useful. Despite the evidence suggesting that vitamins play a far more important role in good health than just preventing diseases like scurvy and rickets, the official advice has not changed.

The news led to widespread claims that taking selenium supplements might ward off heart disease, or perhaps treat it. It even prompted one country, Finland, to pass a law requiring that selenium be added to soil and crops. But now, two decades later, it appears that selenium's power may have been overstated. Various studies in recent years have chipped away at the notion that it has any ability to fight heart disease, and a large study published last month in The American Journal of Epidemiology may have been the final blow. The study followed more than 1,000 American adults for seven and a half years. Some took 200 micrograms of selenium daily, and others were assigned placebos. The subjects provided blood samples twice a year and had their medical records studied closely. After controlling for health habits, background and other factors, the researchers found that selenium had no effect on the risk of developing heart disease or of dying of it. Other studies have found that selenium has no ability to prevent heart disease when it is combined with other antioxidant supplements, like vitamin E. But the news is not all bad for selenium. The study last month found that the selenium group had lower rates of colorectal, prostate and lung cancer than the placebo group, although selenium's anticancer properties are the subject of debate.]]></text>

A recent study in healthy men by Dr. Ishwarlal Jialal and colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas found that a minimum dose of 400 international units of vitamin E a day is needed to counter LDL oxidation.

					<text><![CDATA[Researchers said today that they had the first evidence from a large human study that vitamin supplements could reduce the risk of cancer. The study of nearly 30,000 residents of an area of north-central China where cancer death rates are among the highest in the world showed that nutritional supplements could reduce the risk of dying from cancer and other diseases. The research team, which included Chinese and American scientists, gave residents of Linxian County in Henan Province either a daily dose of vitamins and minerals or a dummy pill over a five-year period. Those receiving a particular combination of supplements -- beta carotene, vitamin E and selenium -- saw their overall cancer death rate drop by 13 percent and the risk of death from all causes decrease by 9 percent, the researchers said.

Although vitamin E has long been known to have some anticoagulant properties (people with bleeding problems are cautioned against taking supplements of it), this clot-breaking ability has largely been ignored by researchers studying its potential role in combating cardiovascular deaths.]]></text>

Studies have indicated that polyphenols may help protect against cancers of the breast, lung, mouth and pancreas. But those studies were done in animals. The studies done in humans, looking for green tea's effects on colon, rectal, stomach, esophageal, pancreatic and bladder cancer, have had conflicting results.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[In recent years, several studies have pointed to the health benefits of green tea. Regular drinkers have less lung, stomach and esophageal cancer, lower rates of cardiovascular disease and fewer strokes. But for some, the pungent drink is, at best, an acquired taste, the cod liver oil of the 90's. So green tea pills have begun to appear on the market, promising all the benefits of the drink without the bouquet of old gym socks. A pill or capsule that contains the essential chemicals found in the liquid form of green tea should provide the same benefits. The key ingredients seem to be an assortment of polyphenols, a broad class of antioxidants found in plants. Antioxidants prevent or delay cell damage that may cause cancer, heart disease and other ailments. A cup of green tea contains about 60 milligrams of polyphenols. One commonly sold capsule contains 242 milligrams, but the amounts vary by manufacturer.]]></text>

The great vitamin C debate has been raging ever since the vitamin first became trendy in the 1960's. Now a biochemist says he has answered the question of how much C the body can absorb and retain, and he has patented the dose. ''I review about 5,000 scientific and medical papers a year,'' said Roc Ordman, chairman of the biochemistry department at Beloit College. ''Not a single one recommends a dose a reasonable person should take. I was discussing this with a colleague and he said, 'There's no point in taking vitamin C because it comes right out in the urine.' '' The Federal Agriculture Department's recommended daily allowance is 60 milligrams. But recent studies on antioxidants have indicated that it might be beneficial for people to take up to thousands of milligrams a day.]]></text>

In economically depressed Galveston, the state's plans were received grimly. ''There is no way they can compensate everyone who makes a living off the beach in one way or another,'' said Doug Matthews, city manager of Galveston. ''This is a city of 65,000 people, and tourism represents about one-third of our economy, more than $300 million a year.

			<description>Why was USAF 1st LT Kelly Flinn, the first female B52 bomber pilot, discharged from the Air Force?</description>
			<narrative>Relevant documents will include reasons why the first female B52 bomber pilot, USAF 1stLt Kelly Flinn was discharged from the service.   She had an affair with a married civilian whose wife was an enlisted member in Lt Flinn’s unit, lied about it, and was on the verge of a court martial proceeding when she was granted a general discharge by the Secretary of the Air Force.  I am interested understanding both Lt. Flinn’s perspective on what she did and how her case should be resolved; and the Air Force’s evolving position, which was influenced by public and Congressional interest in the case and charges of a double standard in its handling of adultery cases.  Information on the civilian involved, Marc Zigo, who spoke out publicly against Flinn after the fact, is also relevant.</narrative>

After Bonds was sworn in, the excerpt says, the prosecutor Jeff Nedrow explained to him that his immunity did not extend to perjury. Not long after the questioning began, Bonds, according to the book, was shown documents from steroid tests completed on samples of his blood and urine, doping calendars and ledgers that logged his testosterone levels, then was asked about the ''cream'' and the ''clear,'' two undetectable steroids.

The ball flies out of the park, or it doesn't. But McGwire's recent admission that he has used a testosterone-boosting compound for the past year has led him and his fans into a place where uncertainties abound. The substance used by McGwire, called andro stenedione and originally developed for performance enhancement by East Germany's state-sponsored athletic drug program in the 1970's, in many ways epitomizes the new wave of performance drugs that is sweeping through the sports world, and its use underscores the ambiguities and questions that have arisen: What do these substances do? How can they be detected? Should they be legal? If they are legal, is it ethically right to take them? How should fans feel about athletes who do?]]></text>

In their second straight day on Capitol Hill, N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern and Billy Hunter, the executive director of the N.B.A. players union, appeared before the House Committee on Government Reform. On Wednesday, in testimony before the consumer protection subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Stern told the panel that during recent negotiations with the players union, he proposed tougher sanctions for players who test positive for steroids. But lawmakers heaped scorn on the N.B.A.'s testing program, calling it inadequate, pathetic and a joke. '']]></text>

''We are going to invest $50 million in the doping struggle,'' he proclaimed. ''We have won many battles, but not the war. Yet that, too, we will win. I just don't know when.'' Almost a year later, this now-forgotten public relations stunt can be appreciated as the desperate gesture it was. A month earlier, the world swimming championships in Perth, Australia, had been ruined by a doping scandal involving the Chinese athletes and officials Samaranch had long defended. And worse was yet to come. The Tour de France doping scandal that erupted in July exposed the underground drug culture of an entire sport that might well come back to haunt the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. A month later, the controversy over Mark McGwire's use of the hormonal ''supplement'' androstenedione made headlines around the world, thereby recruiting an international cohort of adolescent customers who place their drug orders on the Internet.]]></text>

The decision by Discovery leaves the top United States team scrambling to find a primary sponsor at a time when the sport is in turmoil because of accusations of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by riders. The team will continue to ride under the Discovery Channel name this year, beginning with the Tour of California, a one-week race that begins Feb. 18 in San Francisco. But the search for a primary sponsor for 2008 comes as team officials acknowledge that some of the team's current, lower-level sponsors have expressed doubts about their continued affiliation with the sport because of doping.

They are the results of repeated blood tests, part of a drastic and innovative anti-doping program the team began here last month in an attempt to prove its riders are clean. Antidoping scientists say the program, which includes blood and urine testing, is the new paradigm in the fight against doping because it tries to close loopholes in the current system. Cycling is not alone among major sports in trying to stem its doping problems, but none of them use programs as aggressive as this one. Instead of relying on drug tests or police investigations, this method tries to weed out those who use performance-enhancing drugs by catching them before they win a trophy or wear a race leader's yellow jersey.]]></text>

Baseball and union officials also announced an expanded list of banned substances, although players will not be tested for amphetamines. The announcement, made at a meeting of baseball owners in Scottsdale, Ariz., amounted to the players' union response to pressure from the government, fans and some of its own members to take a stronger stand against steroids; the players had resisted testing for any drugs, saying it was an invasion of their privacy. Baseball owners also largely ignored the topic for years. Online Lead Paragraph:]]></text>

When a doping investigation involved some of track and field's most high-profile figures, the sprinter Justin Gatlin continued to compete, untouched. But last week, Landis, the Tour de France winner, and Gatlin, who shares the world record in the 100 meters, were no longer on the outside looking in.

Now, with Floyd Landis testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the Tour de France, cycling may be encountering its toughest battle for legitimacy yet. Landis could be stripped of his Tour de France title if a secondary urine sample confirms the positive result, and some people in cycling are wondering whether something drastic -- like temporarily shutting down the sport -- is necessary to prevent a terminal exodus of sponsors and disillusioned fans.

					<text><![CDATA[The hearing that will determine whether Floyd Landis keeps his 2006 Tour de France title started Monday with legal maneuvering, dense scientific testimony and an unusual photo for the family album. Landis's mother, Arlene, hustled to the front of the Darling Trial Courtroom at Pepperdine University's School of Law, digital camera in hand, just before opening statements. While her son sat next to his lawyers at the defense table, she snapped one photo of him from afar. Then, in her traditional Mennonite white bonnet, she moved in for a close-up. Only after she commemorated the event did three arbitrators begin to hear arguments about whether Floyd Landis used performance-enhancing drugs during cycling's most prestigious race. The United States Anti-Doping Agency has accused Landis of failing a drug test after his stunning performance during Stage 17 of the Tour de France. On that day last July, Landis rode solo over three Alpine passes to set himself up for victory. His urine sample from him that day revealed a testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio of 11 to 1, nearly three times the limit of four to one set by the World Anti-Doping Agency. A more sophisticated test also showed that traces of synthetic testosterone were in that urine sample.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[LAST year at this time, the cynics were smiling their smug smiles and saying, ''I told you so,'' when the red Michelin Guide, France's restaurant report card, was published. It punished Alain Ducasse for his supposed hubris in opening an elaborate Paris restaurant bearing his name while still trying to run another three-star establishment, Louis XV in the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo. Open only seven months at the time the guide was published, the Paris restaurant was awarded three stars. But Louis XV went from three to two (Monaco is included in the guide to France). It was a temporary rebuke. Monday, when Michelin announced the winners and losers for the 1998 guide, Mr. Ducasse, who commutes regularly between Paris and Monte Carlo, made history: he is the first chef to earn six Michelin stars. His rating in Paris was unchanged, and his third star was restored in Monte Carlo, where, he had contended, last year's demotion was unwarranted anyway.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[If Mr. Loiseau's future is problematic, his Paris colleague Alain Ducasse is really walking a financial high wire. Mr. Ducasse won his first three-star rating from Michelin in 1990 for his restaurant Louis XV in Monaco. In 1996, when he won another three-star rating for his Paris restaurant Alain Ducasse, Michelin dropped the Louis XV to two stars. Last year, the lost star was restored, making Mr. Ducasse the first in recent times to hold six stars at one time. Capitalizing on his fame -- and his obvious ability -- Mr. Ducasse has been expanding at top speed. From his office on a top floor of the town house that is his premier Paris restaurant, he directs a small empire that includes the two three-star restaurants; a luxury country inn in Provence, La Bastide de Moustiers, and three other restaurants in Paris. In addition, he is president of a chain of hotels, has produced books and recordings, endorses products, consults with restaurants around the world and appears regularly on television and radio. A financial publication estimated his gross income in 1998 to be around $30 million. Usually photographed in a white chef's jacket, Mr. Ducasse, like most media-savvy three-star chefs, actually spends little if any time at his ovens. Mindful that the Michelin inspectors take a dim view of chefs who rarely visit their own kitchens, he jets between Monaco and Paris to keep an eye on the plats du jour.]]></text>

"No woman was ever a great cook," he once told a group of American women. "A woman cooks like her mother, to please a man. But when men cook, it's to please themselves.

Each spring it gives and takes away coveted star ratings of French restaurants, one of this country's most important industries, sending a frisson through the culinary world. The question this year was whether Alain Ducasse, the French chef who last summer reopened the hottest restaurant in Paris under his own name, taking over from Joel Robuchon, would succeed in keeping Mr. Robuchon's three stars, the guide's highest rating. Mr. Ducasse already has three stars for the Louis XV, his restaurant in Monaco.]]></text>

Oustau de Baumaniere in Les Baux de Provence, opened by Raymond Thuilier in 1946, was first awarded Michelin's three-star rating in 1954. In addition, Louis XV in Monaco, was promoted from two stars to three, leaving the number of top-rated establishments at 19, five of them in Paris. The Baumaniere demotion was not unexpected, for although Mr. Thuilier is still at the luxury hotel-restaurant, the cuisine of his nephew and chef, Jean-Andre Charial, has been criticized for a lack of spontaneity and freshness. Nor was there widespread surprise at the promotion of 33-year-old Alain Ducasse, chef of Louis XV in the Hotel de Paris in Monaco.]]></text>

And last summer, the chef took the butter off the tables and set them with five different varieties of olive oil -- Italian olive oil. Quelle horreur! "There are no borders anymore," said a retired inspector for the Michelin guide in Paris, who commented only on condition of anonymity. For a country that wears its epicurean superiority as proudly as some citizens wear their Legion of Honor pins, the blurring of national culinary borders is as inconceivable as the establishment of a single standard European currency.

It was later run by his parents, Georges and Irma Bocuse. In 1959, his father died and the restaurant became his. Even as he was reluctant to open any business abroad, he became an ambassador of French cuisine. The same year he won his third Michelin star, he went to Japan to take a class with Shizuo Tsuji, a great master in Osaka.

A business graduate, she slipped into the kitchen through an office, but not just any office: it was the Monte Carlo headquarters of Alain Ducasse, who was the chef of the Louis XV restaurant there at the time. ''Mine is not the typical French story of starting in the kitchen at 15,'' Ms. Darroze, 37, said. ''I was 25 when I graduated from business school. I wanted to work for Mr. Ducasse, so I telephoned him and found out there was a six-month wait for an opening in the office. In the meantime, to do something, I started working in the kitchen, in garde-manger, peeling vegetables.'' That was in 1990. ''It was just before Mr. Ducasse got his third star for the Louis XV,'']]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[The most disheartening case is that of Alain Ducasse. In the late 90's, Ducasse, who turns 50 this year, was widely seen as a younger, perhaps more energetic version of Robuchon. Well-heeled Americans flocked to his restaurants in Paris and Monte Carlo and came back raving. Now in charge of a business that operates, among other enterprises, around 30 hotels and restaurants worldwide, including a record three three-star Michelin restaurants, Ducasse has traded his sizzle for cash. Whether you eat in Paris, New York, Monaco or Las Vegas (I've been to all of these and more), the most notable aspect of his restaurants is their cost. Ducasse's Waterloo may be the Essex House in New York, an establishment that the New York restaurant consultant Clark Wolf describes as ''despicable, loathsome and ugly,'' to which I would add ''boring.'' I revisited the six-year-old restaurant a couple of months ago, and the food was beyond dull. A ''mosaic of selected vegetables with natural dressing'' was essentially steamed root vegetables in their own juices, and a small piece of blue-foot chicken ($30 supplement) made me crave KFC. This meal, which included a couple of other lifeless preparations, some of which were not only dull but flawed, cost $600 for two, including tip and the extravagant total of two glasses of wine. Oh, well. If you don't get your money's worth, you don't go back. (In this case, rumor has it that it's Ducasse who's leaving New York, a rumor his spokeswoman denies.) The night I was there, however, the restaurant was full. The global economy has made Ducasse a brand name (this is crucial to the financial, if not culinary, success of the international chef). Many of his customers are regulars or have visited his operations elsewhere; others just know him as the nine-star Michelin chef.]]></text>

Indeed, St. Etienne has had an image problem. First its coal industry collapsed. Then the steel industry went. Later the country's largest mail order business, Manufrance, went bankrupt. Finally even its legendary soccer team was eclipsed by the likes of Marseilles and Monaco. So it was an event of transcendent improbability this month when the French culinary bible, the Michelin guide, raised the Pierre Gagnaire restaurant here to the coveted three-star status, the ultimate accolade for any establishment. With the promotion, Mr. Gagnaire joined the likes of Paul Bocuse and Pierre Troisgros in this country's rarefied gastronomic firmament. But for the chef's hometown, ill prepared for an invasion of epicureans, the Michelin decision poses a challenge.]]></text>

Here, in an old house on the main road leading into San Sebastian, Mr. Arzak serves a cuisine that is sophisticated, using sauces done with a light, contemporary touch. Fish is emphasized, and game in season. The decor is homey, mixing Spanish farmhouse antiques and copper pieces and sprays of fresh flowers. The women who compose most of the staff are dressed traditionally in sober black uniforms with starched white collars and cuffs. Disappointingly, I found the two dining rooms too crowded, with tables close together, and the service lackluster, without the usual warm Basque welcome. But Mr. Arzak deserves praise for his magic at the stove.]]></text>

One of them is this three-star restaurant in Dreis, a hilly town a few miles farther up the Mosel. Any Michelin three-star restaurant has to conform to certain standards of comfort and service, so the sumptuous linens and the attentive waiters who appear en masse from out of the woodwork every so often are to be expected. What's surprising about Sonnora is the decor, almost a parody of three-star style with its walls of pale yellow and cream trimmed in gold, thick red carpeting and kitschy niches stuffed with smirking cherubs, and a garish modern painting over a fireplace for contrast. With the stage thus set, the delicacy of Helmut Thieltge's cooking comes as a complete surprise,]]></text>

Still, there were some wonderful things, and the dessert soufflés were exquisite. Mr. Gagnaire is admirably willing to take risks, which is rare in three-star chefs.]]></text>

A fava salad comes with frisee, fennel and sheets of thin, hard, dry pecorino that are so strong the cheese obliterates the flavor of the vegetables. Something similar happens in another salad, where scallops, shrimp, lentils, tomatoes and black truffle bits somehow neutralize rather than enhance one another.

This explains its pleasurable and powerfully self-reinforcing effects. Nicotine also releases an array of other neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine and vasopressin that mediate its other effects, like arousal, alertness and relaxation. Anyone who doubts the addictive power of nicotine should reflect on the fact that 50 percent of smokers who have heart attacks continue to smoke.]]></text>

Here, researchers have two very large groups of subjects, most of whom do not have the social complications of dealing in illicit substances. Why should depression and nicotine addiction tend to occur in the same people? It could be that smoking causes depression or that depression causes smoking. The second theory is especially tempting because nicotine usually has a euphoric, stimulating effect that depressed people might find particularly rewarding. Whether that would lead someone who is prone to depression to start smoking, however, is another question.]]></text>

The finding caps a decade or more of intensive brain research seeking the grail of substance abuse, the neurological circuitry that compels addicts to pursue the next fix. And the discovery confirms a number of emerging scientific hunches about the neurology of addiction. For instance, no matter what the addictive substance is -- amphetamines, heroin, alcohol or nicotine -- all seem to activate a single circuit for pleasure deep in the most ancient part of the brain. This circuit, for the neurotransmitter dopamine, is the site of the high that addictive drugs bring.]]></text>

Levels of nicotine in the blood are similar in magnitude in people using different forms of tobacco. With regular use, levels of nicotine accumulate in the body during the day and persist overnight. Thus, daily tobacco users are exposed to the effects of nicotine 24 hours each day. 3. Nicotine that enters the blood is rapidly distributed to the brain. As a result, effects of nicotine on the central nervous system occur rapidly after a puff of cigarette smoke. 4. Acute and chronic tolerance develops to many effects of nicotine. Such tolerance is consistent with reports that initial use of tobacco products, such as in adolescents first beginning to smoke, is usually accompanied by a number of unpleasant symptoms which disappear following chronic tobacco use.

Smoking has been banned in most public buildings, at work sites and on public transportation and is becoming increasingly unacceptable in restaurants, private homes and cars. Smokers, no longer welcome to light up with cocktails or coffee, while reading the paper or doing their work, are being forced to go outside when they can no longer resist the urge. Yet forty-six million American adults continue to smoke, mainly because nicotine, like heroin and crack cocaine, is an addictive drug. For smokers who have become dependent on nicotine, each dose -- each cigarette -- sets up a craving for the next one. If that craving is not satisfied, the smoker begins to experience withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness, disturbed sleep, hunger and a strong urge for nicotine.]]></text>

But the program does a tidy job of packaging a dispute that, as the narrator notes, involves science, politics, jobs and public health. The scientific consensus (excepting scientists in the pay of the tobacco companies) is that nicotine is indeed highly addictive, working on the body much like alcohol, cocaine or heroin, although cigarette manufacturers emphasize that it does not have the invidious effects of those drugs.

					<text><![CDATA[Why is it so hard to quit smoking cigarettes? One reason may be that nicotine acts on the same brain system in humans as heroin and morphine, a new study has found. Earlier studies in animals had found that that nicotine could set off the release of brain chemicals called opioids, which play a role in suppressing pain and causing pleasurable feelings. The new study is the first to establish that the same process occurs in people, the researchers said. To prove that opioids were involved, the researchers first had to figure out a way to use positron emission tomography or PET scanners to measure opioid brain activity. They also had to persuade officials at the University of Michigan to waive the no-smoking rules and allow their volunteers to smoke in the hospital's scanner. (They solved the problem by figuring out a way to vent the smoke to the outside.) The study, led by David J. Scott, a graduate student, found that smokers appeared to have an increased flow of opioids in the brain all the time. After they smoked a cigarette, there was even more opioid activity in the parts of the brain involved in emotion and desire. The findings were presented last week at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.]]></text>

Hearings on Smoking This week, the Food and Drug Administration is holding hearings to consider whether cigarettes fit in the array of addictive drugs and whether the Government should regulate them. The standard definition of addiction comes from the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization, which list nine criteria for determining addiction. The two groups, which prefer the term drug dependence, base their definition on research done since the 1960's, which has determined that multiple traits must be considered in determining whether a substance is addictive.

Scientists have found, for instance, that nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or amphetamines, and for most people more addictive than alcohol. Its hooks go deep, involving complex physiological and psychological mechanisms that drive and maintain smoking behavior and that even produce some ''good'' effects, such as improved performance on intellectual, computational and stressful tasks. The bad effects are legion. Tobacco use is the number one preventable cause of illness and death in the United States.

Although many health experts previously determined that nicotine use was a form of addiction, the widespread publicity given the Surgeon General's assessment, at a time when smoking is being restricted in an increasing number of public places, has focused attention on the difficulties most smokers face. No longer, experts say, can physicians look upon smoking simply as a bad habit, like biting one's fingernails, that can be readily broken once its undesirability is recognized.

The agency's mission is usually to prevent substances with severe side effects from being sold at all, except in special cases, as with chemotherapy drugs for cancer. But while it proposed last week that nicotine in tobacco products be declared a drug subject to F.D.A. jurisdiction, the agency is suggesting a regulatory strategy that is altogether different. If the White House approves the F.D.A.'s proposal, cigarettes would become subject to some regulations but not to others.]]></text>

The warning came in the Surgeon General's annual report on the health consequences of smoking. The Surgeon General, Dr. C. Everett Koop, said he hoped the new focus on the addictive nature of tobacco would encourage new antismoking efforts by Federal, state and local officials. The 618-page report's discussion of addiction did not break new scientific ground, but rather synthesized the work of more than 50 scientists and the review of more than 2,000 scientific articles, officials said. Its conclusions reflected the growing belief among experts that the use of tobacco should be viewed as a serious form of addiction, rather than simply a dangerous habit.]]></text>

His proposals are aimed at the right target -- saving youth before they become hooked for life -- and would achieve that goal without limiting the free choice of adult smokers to use a lawful product. The only questionable element is restrictions on advertising that appear to infringe the commercial free-speech rights of the industry. If Republicans or tobacco-state senators in Congress do not like the notion of regulatory intervention, as many now complain, they have only their own failure to confront this urgent public health issue to blame.

Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and eight other institutions have just started a major study of a vaccine that seeks to block the pleasurable sensations of satisfying a nicotine addiction. The vaccine would stimulate production of antibodies that would latch onto nicotine molecules and prevent them from reaching the brain. The effort to find a nicotine vaccine is part of an emerging wave of research into vaccines against addictive substances. Researchers and pharmaceutical companies are also investigating vaccines that would generate antibodies against cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Even if the trial of the nicotine vaccine, called NicVax, proved successful, it would take at least two years before the product reached the market, researchers said. Two other nicotine vaccine candidates are in the pipeline, said Dr. Frank Vocci, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's division of pharmacotherapies. But NicVax, made by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, is further along.]]></text>

The battery-powered ''smoking system'' is the first of its kind and cost $200 million to develop after years of research. The device is a beeper-sized, four-ounce box containing a specially designed cigarette and an electronically controlled lighter that runs on rechargeable batteries. The tobacco burns only when puffed; smokers could take a puff from a cigarette in its holder, put it down and take another puff an hour later. But smokers must lift the device to their lips for each puff, as if smoking a kazoo. That is not exactly the cool image of Humphrey Bogart with a cigarette dangling from his lips. One future sight could well be a person walking with a cellular phone in one hand, the smoking device in the other -- and no more hands for carrying the laptop computer. Critics say the device demonstrates the lengths to which the tobacco industry will go to make a dangerous addiction more socially acceptable. Richard A. Daynard, chairman of an anti-tobacco group, the Tobacco Products Liability Project at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, dismissed it as ''clearly another nicotine-delivery device.'']]></text>

Premier, RJR Nabisco's smokeless, ashless, tarless cigarette, has gone up in smoke. Sales in two test markets fell far short of expectations and the financially pressed tobacco giant was unwilling to risk millions in search of a market. The debacle is likely to please anti-smoking advocates who worried that smokers would seize on the Premier as an excuse not to quit. It will certainly make life easier for the Food and Drug Administration, under pressure to declare Premier a drug delivery system and thus subject to regulation - a decision that would have unleashed the wrath of the tobacco lobby. But the death of the Premier is no victory for millions of hard-core nicotine addicts who know the risks and smoke anyway. Obviously no smoking is better than smoking, but the best should not be the enemy of the good. There's a strong social case for encouraging manufacturers to develop safer cigarettes that will sell.]]></text>

The campaign, which began Monday, introduces a step-down version of Nicotrol's 16-hour patch, with successive doses containing smaller amounts of nicotine. But the Pharmacia Corporation, which manufactures Nicotrol and now controls the marketing of the patch in the United States, faces a task as daunting as quitting a two-pack-a-day habit. Sales of over-the-counter, or O.T.C., products to help people stop smoking have been stagnant over the last five years. And the market is dominated by GlaxoSmithKline, which has the No. 1 and No. 2 brands in Nicorette gum and the Nicoderm CQ patch]]></text>

The studies are published in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. Researchers from the University of Wisconsin Medical School said current patch doses typically replace less than half the nicotine of a pack of cigarettes a day. Their study applied both 22-milligram and 44-milligram patches to 504 smokers and offered various levels of counseling, often cited as a key element in quitting. They found that although the higher-dose patch lessened the desire to smoke, it did not have better results in terms of actually quitting and produced significant side effects. A Mayo Clinic study in Rochester, Minn., divided 71 smokers into three groups by patch strength. The heavy smokers (two packs a day) all quit after eight weeks with the 44-milligram patch]]></text>

The June 1994 research report also found that altering the nicotine's chemical form likely ''increased the rapidity'' at which nicotine, the addictive substance in cigarettes, entered a smoker's bloodstream, the document shows.

The three judges' ruling overturned a 1995 decision that would have permitted almost any cigarette smoker in the United States to join a suit that could have cost the industry billions of dollars in claims. The lawsuit, which would have been the largest class-action case in American history, accused tobacco companies of concealing evidence that smoking is addictive and of manipulating nicotine levels in cigarettes.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Dr. David A. Kessler, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, held Congress in thrall last week testifying that a leading cigarette maker had secretly developed a breed of tobacco with twice the usual amount of nicotine. The company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, said it blended the plant, called Y-1, with other tobacco, but retained the normal amount of nicotine. Dr. Kessler argued Wednesday that the existence and use of Y-1 proved that the company manipulated the level of nicotine. He contends that cigarettes can be seen as nicotine delivery devices, which the F.D.A. could regulate as drugs. The same day, researchers at the University of Wisconsin reported what they saw as good news on the smoking cessation front: Nicotine patches can double the success rate for those trying to quit. But even with patches, only a quarter of the smokers succeed in stopping.]]></text>

The lawsuit seeks to recover billions of dollars the Federal Government spent on smoking-related health care for elderly Medicare patients, military veterans and Federal employees, expenses not covered by the $246 billion in settlements that the industry reached last year with the states over smoking-related Medicaid costs for the poor and disabled. President Clinton, who first announced in his State of the Union Message last January that the Justice Department would pursue such a lawsuit, told reporters at the White House today that, ''The tobacco companies should answer to the taxpayers for their actions.'' Relying heavily on documents unearthed in the state claims, the lawsuit accuses the tobacco industry of promoting biased research, wrongly asserting that nicotine was not addictive and falsely denying that they were targeting their products to children.]]></text>

After decades of denials, Philip Morris publicly admitted last fall that smoking is addictive and causes cancer and other fatal diseases. This week Steven Parrish, a senior vice president of Philip Morris, said the company was willing to discuss some federal regulation of tobacco. Mr. Parrish also expressed his belief, at a conference sponsored by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, that nicotine is an addictive drug, although not a drug as defined by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. There is good reason to be deeply skeptical of Philip Morris's new stance. After all, the tobacco industry has long been duplicitous while fighting to maintain its right to sell a dangerous product. But that longstanding strategy may be crumbling under the pressure of public denunciations and new legal threats against the cigarette manufacturers.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[A sea of black men at his feet, the Capitol at his back and millions watching him on cable television, Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, delivered the kind of speech today that he often makes to his religious faithful on a lazy Sunday afternoon back home in Chicago. It was part inspiration, conspiracy theory and numerology, with a good dose of black nationalism and the joys and necessity of bootstrap capitalism. He attacked white supremacy in one breath and then turned around and condemned what he called the failures of black manhood. "I point out the evils of black people like no other leader alive," the Muslim minister bellowed, a group of stern-faced members of the Nation's paramilitary detail, the Fruit of Islam, at his sides and back, dressed in their dark blue uniforms. The speech, or "lecture," as he called it, began in bright sunshine and ended near dusk more than two hours later, as thousands of those who had come for his Million Man March began leaving to catch buses back to their cities and towns around the United States.]]></text>

"The question is whether Farrakhan has shot himself in the foot here," Mr. Garrow said. "What looked like a very significant success has been markedly reduced by his going on for more than two hours. He has certainly bruised himself by going on for this long."]]></text>

This leads to perversion of history. Hess was Hitler's deputy 50 years ago, and Kurt Waldheim became President of Austria 50 years later. The difference is that as Hitler's deputy, Hess was a mature man in a powerful and influential position, whereas Mr. Waldheim was an unimportant lieutenant, perhaps 25 years old]]></text>

Surge levels would rise to 20 feet at the Statue of Liberty and more than 26 feet in Jamaica Bay.

''Communities have to be prepared to respond actively,'' said one of the authors, Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs. ''In some places, retreat will be the right thing to do, or beach restoration or hardening the coast may be chosen.'' Sea walls, which protect the property directly behind them, often cause worse erosion nearby, he said. Neighboring states have also faced erosion problems. In New York, beaches and dunes on the South Shore of Long Island and bluffs on the island's North Shore sustained significant erosion leading into the winter.]]></text>

			<description>Identify Harry Connick Jr's involvement in Broadway theater.</description>
			<narrative>Any information on Harry Connick Jr's involvement with Broadway theaters was relevant.  (I used Wikipedia's list of theaters considered to be "on" Broadway.)  He was involved with Broadway productions as a singer, composer, and actor.  Also relevant was any information that indicated he tried out for or was considered for a Broadway production.  Connick's appearances elsewhere in NYC was not relevant, nor were his roles in movies.  His presence at Broadway award ceremonies, either as a performer or presenter, was not relevant.</narrative>

He and the director Trevor Nunn have been holding casting calls for male and female leads. Spokesmen for the show were mum on casting, but those in the know say that Marc Kudisch (the cocaine-sniffing ambisexual in ''The Wild Party'') and, even more enticingly, Harry Connick Jr., have been sighted coming and going to audition rooms.]]></text>

Previous uptown expansions jettisoned by the Whitney include a $37 million addition by Michael Graves canceled in 1985 and a $200 million design by Rem Koolhaas scrapped in 2003.]]></text>

Its permanent collection is housed in a four-year-old museum in Beacon, N.Y., created from an abandoned 1929 box factory along the Hudson River. In 2004 Dia moved out of its two gallery spaces on West 22nd Street in Chelsea, renting one and letting the other sit empty, saying neither was suited for its growing number of visitors. It then announced its intention to move to a site on Washington Street by the entrance to the High Line, an abandoned elevated railway line that is being transformed into a park. But in October, Dia abandoned plans to transform a building there into a museum. (The Whitney Museum of American Art now plans to build a downtown satellite designed by Renzo Piano on the same site.)]]></text>

The museum might consider adding another: ''Pink and Tan,'' Noah Sheldon's solo exhibition at the D'Amelio Terras Gallery in Chelsea. It's simple. The Met acquires ''Pink and Tan'' lock, stock and barrel -- or rather, player piano, wind chime and lighted pegboard -- and makes it the heart of its 20th-century galleries. There it would function like a modern, slightly Dada version of the Ming Scholar's Court in the Chinese galleries or the George Nakashima wood-paneled reading room in the Japanese galleries:]]></text>

Although Mr. Zimmermann maintained that he was not the person who posted it, he came under investigation by the United States attorney's office in San Jose, Calif., for possible prosecution for violating export laws. Federal officials argued that terrorists and other criminals could use the system to keep their plans secret, even from intelligence agencies.]]></text>

And some systems will require more new parts than others, he said. "You may be lucky," Mr. Mash said. "You may not." Ms. Kueber said Ford had no estimate of the cost to convert a system. But of Mr. Oulouhojian's estimate, she said, "We're very aware that that kind of figure would alarm customers." "We will be there," she said, pledging that Ford would not abandon owners of cars with irreparable air-conditioners. "We will satisfy you, but I can't tell you now how." The changeover of Ford factories to R-134a will be "virtually 100 percent" by the 1995 models, she added. A spokesman for the Chrysler Corporation, Jason Vines, said 1992 and 1993 vehicles could probably be converted for $250 or so, but "for those systems older than 1992, it's obviously going to be more expensive." He added that Chrysler was considering splitting costs with customers or doing the work at cost on late-model cars, to create "happy customers."]]></text>

Some will be relatively simple, others more complicated and expensive. Nevertheless, as R-12 becomes more scarce and costly, auto executives say the conversions will increasingly become the more economical choice. Mr. Oulouhojian said most conversion kits had not yet been developed; their prices are estimated at $200 to $800. He said costs were likely to be lower for newer cars with more modern cooling systems. The cost of completely converting an older car may not make economic sense, he said. But there may be some alternatives, like a partial conversion. "If a customer is willing to accept air that is a few degrees hotter than in the past, the cost may be considerably lower," Mr. Oulouhojian said.]]></text>

Nancy Sander, president of the Allergy and Asthma Network-Mothers of Asthmatics, a patient advocacy group with 5,000 members based in Fairfax, Va., said that the current F.D.A. proposal reflected more concern for the environment than for people with asthma. Surveys indicate that patients favor the development of new inhalers and the elimination of CFC's, she said, but they fear that the process the F.D.A. has suggested may phase out the old ones without first letting patients make sure that the new ones work as well. Ms. Sander also said patients were worried that some old medications would not be reformulated into new inhalers because of the expense of the change and would be lost from the market. ''The F.D.A. needs to continue to understand the needs of patients and to monitor them the same way the Environmental Protection Agency monitors ozone,'' she said. The proposed changes are intended to bring the United States into compliance with the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries to reduce CFC pollution. In keeping with the treaty, the production of the gases was banned for most nonmedical uses in the United States in 1996. Inhaled medications received an ''essential use'' exemption from the treaty because they form the cornerstone of treatment for most of the 12 million to 15 million people with asthma in the nation and a similar number with disorders like emphysema and chronic bronchitis.]]></text>

The products being phased out use chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, to propel a mist of medicine.

					<text><![CDATA[But most of the delegates and observers here said they were optimistic that the protocol would be adopted and ratified. ''We must not fail, for nothing less than the future of the planet earth is at stake,''said Canada's Environment Minister, Tom McMillan. The proposed treaty deals with chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, chemicals used in refrigeration, air conditioning, plastic foams, aerosol sprays, cleaning agents for electronic products and a wide variety of other products. Their use in aerosol sprays has been banned in the United States. The draft protocol would freeze consumption by developed countries at 1986 levels starting Jan. 1, 1990; it would reduce consumption by 20 percent by Jan. 1, 1994, and by as much as an additional 30 percent by Jan. 1, 1999. However, the draft would allow total global production of these chemicals go up by as much as 10 percent over the next 10 years in order to meet the needs of the developing countries for industrial growth. The draft protocol would also freeze consumption of halons, chemicals used as fire supressants, by Jan. 1, 1994, but would not require any rollbacks in their use. Dire Predictions Both CFC's and halons combine chemically with and destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere. That ozone shields the earth's surface from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.]]></text>

The "hole" could not be fully explained by any mechanism then known. It was Dr. Crutzen and his colleagues who identified the mechanism as chemical reactions on the surfaces of cloud particles. The urgency of this finding speeded the negotiation of a 1987 international agreement, the Montreal Protocol, to protect the ozone layer. Under 1992 amendments to the protocol, brought about by findings that ozone depletion was affecting temperate regions, industrialized countries agreed to phase out the production of CFC's by the end of this year.]]></text>

An exception was allowed for the Soviet Union, which would be permitted to freeze at levels prevailing in 1990, when its five-year plan expires. Chlorofluorocarbon consumption would then be rolled back by 20 percent by 1994 and an additional 30 percent by 1999. But global production of the chemicals would be permitted to rise as much as 10 percent over 10 years in order to meet the needs of developing countries for industrial growth. European Community a Hurdle Halon consumption levels would be frozen by 1994, but no rollbacks are planned for these chemicals yet. The major last-minute hurdle faced by the negotiators was a demand by the European Community that its 12 member nations be treated as a single entity and that consumption limits not apply to any one member country. Mr. Thomas said the United States objected to this plan because it would give the European Community a trade advantage not enjoyed by others joining in the protocol. A compromise was reached that would allow the Community to be treated individually, but only after each member state ratified the protocol individually.]]></text>

Elkins of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, who participated in the study.]]></text>

Last year, the administration sought to exclude a variety of farmers and food producers from the ban, which takes effect next year that outlaws substances that harm the ozone layer. The exempt businesses would be allowed 21.9 million pounds of methyl bromide next year and 20.8 million pounds in 2006 in uses like fumigating stored grain and treating golf-course sod and strawberry fields. The new request, filed with United Nations treaty administrators last weekend, would add 1.1 million pounds to the 2005 request, to be used by producers of cut flowers, processed meats and tobacco seedlings. Some American growers say methyl bromide remains vital to compete with countries where cheap laborers do weeding and pest control. Critics of the American requests said the exemptions could undermine the 1987 ozone treaty. Use of methyl bromide has been cut 70 percent in industrialized countries since 1999 under the treaty. Parties to the pact, the Montreal Protocol, are to meet this month in Montreal to consider requests by the United States and other countries.]]></text>

Intercepting or interfering with a ship to prevent smuggling, pollution, mine-laying, or terrorism is not relevant. Attacks on ships during wartime or for other political reasons are not relevant. Digital piracy is not relevant.</narrative>

''How do you revive a dying kangaroo? Well, I started with a big male about 6 feet tall. I got him into an upright position and placed his forepaws on my shoulders. Then, eye to eye, we did the darnedest slow step you ever saw. It wasn't elegant but it worked. ''Finally he grunted, which is the kangaroo's sign of distress, so I knew we would live. When he opened his eyes and saw who his partner was, well, I would have grunted, too. He was still pretty wobbly when I sat him down and started dancing with the next one. I probably spent more than an hour getting the six of them on their feet.''

		<topic name="Shrinking ice sheet in Greenland" id="dd17-50" num_of_subtopics="3">
			<description>The vast majority of environmental scientists agree that the Greenland ice sheet is shrinking at an alarming rate.</description>
			<narrative>While some scientists, like a Danish geologist who says the Greenland ice sheet is relatively stable or even growing, most say it is shrinking rather markedly. One expert warns that if the ice in Greenland were to melt, it would raises the worldwide sea level by 25 feet. Overall, scientists say the melting zone in Greenland increased by 16 percent from 1979 to 2002. They implicate global warming and human involvement in it.</narrative>

The earlier findings, announced in July, seemed to suggest that climactic changes in the current warm period, which began 10,000 years ago, could also be far more rapid -- in spans of decades or less -- than had been thought if the climate gets as warm as it was then.]]></text>

They found that the movement accelerated significantly in summer, when a lot of surface ice melted. For example, the researchers found that in the summers of 1998 and 1999, the rate of movement increased by three to three-and-a-half inches per day above the average midwinter rate of 12 inches per day. In the low-melt summer of 1996, however, the rate increased by less than half an inch per day.]]></text>

When some glaciers reach a critical stage, their flow increases many times. It has been proposed that as the bottom of an ice sheet is warmed by heat from the earth's interior, it becomes slushy, allowing the ice to slip. Cores extracted from sediment under the eastern Atlantic have revealed at least five layers of Canadian pebbles, showing that at certain times, many thousands of years apart, North America shed armies of icebergs that almost reached Europe.]]></text>

In a second article in Science, researchers say they have detected a rising frequency of earthquakelike rumblings in the bedrock beneath Greenland's two-mile-thick ice cap in late summer since 1993. They say there is no obvious explanation other than abrupt movements of the overlying ice caused by surface melting.]]></text>

That, in turn, has allowed ice in the interior to flow more readily to the coast. One of the new surveys, led by H. Jay Zwally, a NASA scientist, used satellites and aircraft to measure changes in the height of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland over the decade ended in 2002. It found a loss of volume in Antarctica and a small overall gain in Greenland, where inland snows have outpaced ice flowing into the sea, at least temporarily. It was just published in The Journal of Glaciology.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Greenland's vast ice cap, which has had expanding melting zones in recent summers, is losing far more water to the sea than it is gaining through snowfall, and is thus contributing to rising sea levels, a research team said. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists, from the University of Texas in Austin, said gravity-measuring satellites showed that 57 cubic miles of ice was being lost annually. Some glaciologists criticized facets of the analysis but said that the study and several different measurement methods confirmed the overall trend. Eric Rignot, a NASA glaciologist, said most experts now agreed that the recent warming of Greenland and the accelerated melting of its glaciers are a ''warming that shows no indication of a slowdown.'']]></text>

Or how intense heat waves, droughts, floods and storms will become? The answer is no, it is not possible to make exact predictions about such complex systems. But there is no uncertainty among the world's leading scientists that if we do not significantly reduce our current levels of burning fossil fuels, our world will experience profound changes, many of them irreversible, in its physical, chemical and biological composition. And there is absolutely no question that these changes will severely threaten life, including human life, on this planet. It would be shamefully ignorant and morally inexcusable if we did not do everything in our power to prevent these changes from occurring.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Peter Wadhams, a scientist at the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University in England, compared the results of ice studies carried out by sonar aboard British submarines in 1976 and 1987. He reported in a recent issue of Nature that in a zone extending about 250 miles north of Greenland, the ice was significantly thinner at the end of the period. The thinning resulted in a loss of more than 15 percent of the ice over an area of more than 185,000 square miles. Among the factors that could have caused the thinning, Dr. Wadhams wrote, is global warming produced by the greenhouse effect, in which increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, much of it from the burning of fossil fuels, traps more heat in the atmosphere. But he also cited other possible causes, mainly changes caused by shifts in wind patterns. The findings were called provocative in an accompanying commentary, whose chief author was A. S. McLaren, a researcher at the Unversity of Colorado who specializes in global climate change and sea ice. But Dr. McLaren said in an interview that the tracks of the two British submarines did not coincide, that their cruises took place in different seasons and that the study did not take account of variations in weather patterns between 1976 and 1987. He and Dr. Wadhams agreed that more data were needed.]]></text>

Greenland's vast ice cap is twice the size of California, and it holds as much water as the Gulf of Mexico. If it all melted, sea levels from Boston to Bangladesh would rise more than 20 feet, experts say. The latest report on sea level trends by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said such melting could take a millennium or more. But because of a lack of long-term measurements and poor understanding of the physics of ice, that analysis largely excluded hints of an accelerating flow of ice and meltwater from Greenland into the seas]]></text>

The level is even far higher now than it was in periods when the climate was much warmer and North America was largely tropical.

They reported in a university announcement that since 1900, the quantity of methanesulfonic acid (a compound of sulfur generated by microorganisms) in the atmosphere has declined by half. Over the same period, atmospheric sulfur created by human activity like burning fossil fuels tripled. Atmospheric sulfur is also produced by volcanoes and chemical reactions in the ocean. Dr. Saltzman said in an interview that he could not account for the change in phytoplankton production. ''We know that some species of phytoplankton generate methanesulfonic acid while others do not, and it may be that proportions of the various species populations have changed,'' he said. ''But we don't know why, or even whether this is the correct explanation. ''One of the problems we've just begun to tackle in looking at these ice records is in relating what we find in Greenland ice to atmospheric changes elsewhere,'' he said. The University of Miami is collaborating with Soviet and French institutions in drawing ice samples at the Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica. ''We know now that the great bulk of sulfur in the atmosphere comes from human rather than natural sources,'' he said.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[The southern half of the Greenland ice sheet, the second largest expanse of land-bound ice on earth, after Antarctica, has shrunk substantially in the last five years, scientists have found in airborne surveys using new and more precise techniques. Experts have said for some time that a warming atmosphere has caused many mountain glaciers around the world to shrink. But until now, they have not known what was happening to the Greenland ice cap. While five years is too short a period to determine a trend, the new findings, reported in today's issue of the journal Science, provide the first precise evidence that it, too, is diminishing. If the big ice sheets melt even partly, sea levels will rise around the world. Melting might also disrupt the ocean currents that modulate the earth's climate by distributing heat around the globe.]]></text>

Last week, in its first major report since 2001, the world's most authoritative group of climate scientists issued its strongest statement yet on the relationship between global warming and human activity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant cause of the observed warming of the last 50 years. In the panel's parlance, this level of certainty is labeled ''very likely.'']]></text>

But one that distributes leather jackets to address the special needs of sadomasochists? Another that hands out new underwear? Critics were opposed to the expedited process before it began, warning that many of the upstart organizations would have short shelf lives, prove difficult to track and monitor, and suck money away from more experienced organizations offering support and services. That is precisely what happened in many cases in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A spot check of the new Hurricane Katrina charities shows that some have indeed disappeared, while others are struggling to help storm victims or to broaden their mission after an initial spurt of activity. Over all, about $3.6 billion has been pledged to Hurricane Katrina-related charities, with roughly 60 percent donated to the American Red]]></text>

Officials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50 alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings. Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway. Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center. The storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.]]></text>

Entergy says many underground conduits are designed to survive flooding, but some experts are skeptical that the lines will survive weeks under the brackish water. Transformers are soaked. Debris will have to be cleaned out of them and electronic parts replaced. Utilities have extensive mutual-aid agreements, but weeks of work remain. Once the distribution system is restored, inspectors will have to check the wiring of each home and building. ''It's kind of like a house-to-house battle,'' said Jeffrey Corbett, vice president for distribution of Progress Energy, a utility based in Raleigh, N.C. New Orleans will not be habitable by a large population until it has a water supply and a functioning sewer system.

It was flooded from the north and rear by Lake Pontchartrain, when levees failed along the 17th Street and London Avenue drainage canals. Initially, the Corps of Engineers said that the storm was so great that it overtopped these levees also. But after inspecting the levees and reviewing storm data, all three investigating teams agree: Hurricane Katrina hit Lake Pontchartrain with far less strength than it did the Gulf Coast, and the storm surge fell well short of the tops of the levees. In fact, a design or construction flaw caused them to collapse in the face of a force they were designed to hold. In other words, if the levees had performed as they were supposed to, the deaths in New Orleans proper, the scenes in the Superdome and the city's devastation would never have taken place.]]></text>

In adjacent St. Bernard Parish, which was particularly hard hit, 99 percent of homes and businesses remained without power, Mr. Field said. In Orleans Parish, that figure was 89 percent, and in Jefferson Parish, just over 50 percent. As floodwaters recede north toward Lake Pontchartrain, water levels across the city have fallen as much as four feet since Monday. Parts of Interstate 10 that had been flooded are passable, and the city's downtown core is mostly dry.

Both major breaches took place along canals built in decades past as conduits for commerce, Army Corps officials said. The other failure occurred along the Industrial Canal, an 80-year-old channel that had been identified as a weak spot in computer simulations of storm surges from hypothetical hurricanes. Mr. Hall said that as the surge from the storm swept in through Lake Pontchartrain -- actually a broad inlet off the gulf -- it began sloshing over the vertical steel and concrete wall and the earthen berm behind it. ''Once it got over, it began to scour down at the base of that flood wall on the protected side,'' he said. The rising waters in the canal pushed in on the high part of the retaining wall while water cascading over the top ate away at the base, Mr. Hall said, adding: ''The effect is like a high-low tackle in football. You hit the head and feet at the same time from opposite directions, and it goes down.'']]></text>

On Sunday, leaders in the House and Senate moved to switch from a relief effort to recovery, agreeing to appropriate large chunks of money to rebuild the region and, at least in part, to bail out some of the tens of thousands of people who were financially devastated by the storm. The recovery package allocates $11.5 billion in new grant money, mostly for Mississippi and Louisiana. State officials have indicated they intend to use much of it to compensate some of the estimated 110,000 families whose homes were flooded by Hurricane Katrina but who did not have flood insurance. The deal also includes $2.68 billion to strengthen the levees, protect the watershed and take other flood-control measures around New Orleans and elsewhere on the Gulf Coast. There is $2.75 billion to reimburse states for highway repairs.]]></text>

The federal aid hot line mentioned by President Bush in his address to the nation on Thursday cannot handle the flood of calls, leaving thousands of people unable to get through for help, day after day. Federal officials are often unable to give local governments permission to proceed with fundamental tasks to get their towns running again. Most areas in the region still lack federal help centers, the one-stop shopping sites for residents in need of aid for their homes or families. Officials say that they are uncertain whether they can meet the president's goal of providing housing for 100,000 people who are now in shelters by the middle of next month. While the agency has redoubled its efforts to get food, money and temporary shelter to the storm victims, serious problems remain throughout the affected region. Visits to several towns in Louisiana and Mississippi, as well as interviews with dozens of local and federal officials, provide a portrait of a fragmented and dysfunctional system.]]></text>

In interviews and a telephone conference call with reporters, senior officials and engineers from up and down the ranks of the Army Corps of Engineers conceded that they had no ability to detect quickly small breaches in the matrix of 350 miles of levees around New Orleans.]]></text>

Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana for the first time unveiled a real package of assistance on Monday, proposing to use federal money for loans and grants that aides said would spur rebuilding in devastated areas. For months an unpromising brew of competing ideas, inadequate money and political fighting has left Louisiana homeowners devastated by Hurricane Katrina in limbo, wondering where to turn for help. Some have returned and are rebuilding on their own, but many thousands more remain in exile, without the money needed to come back and start over. More than 330,000 homes sustained some damage, state officials say.]]></text>

For reasons of practicality and politics, officials at the Justice Department and the Pentagon, and then at the White House, decided not to urge Mr. Bush to take command of the effort. Instead, the Washington officials decided to rely on the growing number of National Guard personnel flowing into Louisiana, who were under Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco's control.]]></text>

Louisiana and Mississippi politicians said it was a first step in helping rebuild an area in which neighborhoods and whole towns remain wiped out, though the money is largely a reshuffling of the $62 billion that Congress set aside shortly after the hurricane. Most critically, the package gives the two states wide latitude to spend an $11.5 billion community development block grant on a variety of projects, including help for people whose houses were destroyed. On Friday, Mississippi made plans to use the money for $150,000 outlays to 30,000 homeowners whose houses were flooded but who lacked flood insurance because they lived outside the flood plain. Louisiana has 70,000 homeowners in the same situation, and many more ruined houses over all than Mississippi. Its share of the block grant will not go nearly as far in compensating homeowners.]]></text>

At the increasingly unsanitary convention center, crowds swelled to about 25,000 and desperate refugees clamored for food, water and attention while dead bodies, slumped in wheelchairs or wrapped in sheets, lay in their midst. ''Some people there have not eaten or drunk water for three or four days, which is inexcusable,'' acknowledged Joseph W. Matthews, the director of the city's Office of Emergency Preparedness. ''We need additional troops, food, water,'' Mr. Matthews begged, ''and we need personnel, law enforcement. This has turned into a situation where the city is being run by thugs.'' Three days after the hurricane hit, bringing widespread destruction to the Gulf Coast and ruinous floods to low-lying New Orleans, the White House said President Bush would tour the region on Friday. Citing the magnitude of the disaster, federal officials defended their response so far and pledged that more help was coming. The Army Corps of Engineers continued work to close a levee breach that allowed water from Lake Pontchartrain to pour into New Orleans. The effects of the disaster spilled out over the country. In Houston, the city began to grapple with the logistics of taking tens of thousands of refugees into the Astrodome. American Red Cross officials said late Thursday night that the Astrodome was full after accepting more than 11,000 refugees and that evacuees were being sent to other shelters in the Houston area.]]></text>

A preliminary assessment from the oyster industry, one of Louisiana's flourishing seafood businesses, found that while the western side of the state fared well, everything east of Bayou Lafourche to the Mississippi line was ruined. The area accounts for two-thirds of the state's oyster harvesting, or $181 million a year. With federal aid, officials said, it could take two to three years for the crop to return. The frenzied pursuit of gasoline by motorists in the region did not slacken, and disruptions of routines continued. In Georgia, schools in Hancock County were closed on Thursday because of a gasoline shortage. Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia signed an executive order temporarily halting state collection of all motor fuel taxes, effective after midnight Friday. This should reduce gas prices by about 15 cents a gallon. Mr. Perdue said he hoped to keep the moratorium in effect through September, but needed the approval of the legislature, which will convene a special session starting Tuesday.]]></text>

The fears changed troop deployments, delayed medical evacuations, drove police officers to quit, grounded helicopters. Edwin P. Compass III, the police superintendent, said that tourists -- the core of the city's economy -- were being robbed and raped on streets that had slid into anarchy. The mass misery in the city's two unlit and uncooled primary shelters, the convention center and the Superdome, was compounded, officials said, by gangs that were raping women and children. A month later, a review of the available evidence now shows that some, though not all, of the most alarming stories that coursed through the city appear to be little more than figments of frightened imaginations, the product of chaotic circumstances that included no reliable communications, and perhaps the residue of the longstanding raw relations between some police officers and members of the public.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[With a $2,000 federal tax credit and generous rebates from states like New Jersey and California, it has never cost less to install a solar power system. And it still makes no economic sense. You might want photovoltaic solar panels to generate your own electricity out of a belief that you will save the planet. But, as is the case with hybrid vehicles, you certainly should not do it to save money. An online calculator (www.findsolar.com/index.php?page=rightforme) created by solar power advocates and the Department of Energy demonstrates just how hard it is to justify the switch. For instance, a homeowner in New Jersey whose electric bill is an above-average $100 a month could buy a system for about $54,000, it says. After the state rebate of $18,468 and the $2,000 federal tax credit, the system would cost $33,532. And how many years will it take before you see any savings? From 11 to 22 years. The average payback is 14 years, said Polly N. Shaw, a senior regulatory analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission.]]></text>

In bald financial terms, power made with fossil fuel or nuclear power remains much cheaper than using backyard sun to power hot water and electricity. One energy consultant, Joel Gordes who runs Environmental Energy Solutions in Colebrook, estimates that solar electrical systems provide $140 worth of electricity per year. Then there is the cost of the equipment itself. For a typical house, the photovoltaic panels and related equipment for electricity, combined with the solar hot-water equipment, cost about $35,000. This means that owners of solar systems will recoup their investments between 15 and 20 years after these systems go on line.]]></text>

Buying an energy-conserving new refrigerator-freezer like the Sun Frost RF16, which has two separate cooling compartments and no fan, will lead to more savings than installing solar cells to generate electricity because an investment in solar cells takes decades to recoup, but the cost of a new refrigerator can be recovered in a few years. Not surprisingly, those who live in New York and California, where energy costs are high, will always save more with energy-efficient products. Most importantly, when consumers buy something labeled green or energy efficient, they have not necessarily helped their pocketbook or the planet.]]></text>

''The program targets the lower-income population because it is focusing on those who are not able to make energy-efficient improvements to their home that would lower their electric bill,'' Mr. Zaweski said. Under the program, the total cost of a household's improvements is capped at $10,000. To qualify, applicants must fall within the required income guidelines and reside in homes that they own. They receive a grant to pay for 50 percent of the cost and may choose to arrange their own financing for the balance -- as the Weisses did -- or receive a C.D.C. loan at a fixed rate of 3 percent repayable over six years.]]></text>

The carrot is the falling cost of solar systems that are lighter and more efficient and feature new designs, like solar panels that double as window awnings. Standardized installations and economies of scale for equipment production have helped drive costs lower. In moving toward the energy mainstream, solar expenses have dropped to around $8 a watt, from roughly $100 three decades ago; the cost is even less if a system is installed as part of a new home's construction. In either case, that puts the price of a system that can reduce electric bills significantly -- like a three-kilowatt system -- in the $20,000 range. That's still a lot of money, but buyers may be able to get a lot of it back immediately, through government incentives. And with energy prices rising, the payback period for the rest is getting steadily shorter.]]></text>

I make all of my electricity and store it in batteries -- enough to run lights, a computer, fax, power tools, a water pump. The latest estimate is that California's failed experiment with deregulation will cost consumers $5 billion annually in increased rates. Watching the sun glint off my solar panels, I was moved to find out how many of them could be purchased for $1 billion. The answer is about one million 110 watt, 110 volt, utility-ready panels, the easiest kind for consumers to use. (My system uses five panels). At peak power output on a California summer afternoon -- when blackouts are most likely to occur -- those one million panels would produce about 100 megawatts of electricity.]]></text>

Fuel shortages were predicted and tax credits for renewable-energy installations tempted homeowners. Then, as fuel prices started to fall, the Reagan Administration ended special tax credits and stories began to emerge of systems not fulfilling their glowing promises and of manufacturers and contractors who vanished. Now solar energy appears headed for a comeback. Concern about finite resources, polluted air and global warming, and talk of a new surge in fuel prices, have encouraged homeowners to give solar another chance.

With $850 million in sales last year, American manufacturers remain the global leaders in systems that make electricity from sunlight. Orders are months ahead of production and several companies are building new plants to turn out more solar cells. Demand is so strong and the current shortage is so acute that prices for solar cells are even on the rise -- reversing a decade-long price decline driven by more efficient technology and improved manufacturing processes. So why is the industry so worried about its future? Because so far most of the demand for solar-power systems is overseas.]]></text>

As environmentally-conscious citizens with an understandable liking for saving money, the Rouse's installed solar panels on the roof of their home in Hamilton Township, next to Trenton. Not only would they save energy and combat global warning, but they would qualify for a $2,000 credit on their federal income taxes and a significant state subsidy for installing the panels. The stipends are aimed at encouraging energy conservation. But then came a surprise. As reported in The Times of Trenton, a local assessor noticed the newly-installed panels, deemed that they constituted a property improvement, and socked the Rouse's with a $12,000 increased tax assessment. The result is an annual tax hike of at least $500, which in a few years will more than offset the state's subsidy, federal income tax credit and energy savings. The maddening aspect is that the state itself made the higher assessment possible. Solar panels were exempt from property taxes until 1988, but when that exemption expired, Trenton issued an advisory encouraging local assessors to tax them.]]></text>

That was when lawmakers added fees to the utility bills of United Illuminating and Connecticut Light and Power ratepayers to help pay to increase sources of nonpolluting power. The average ratepayer is charged 70 cents a month for this purpose, which goes into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund. The fund pays for solar electric initiatives.

But several of the nation's leading solar power experts say Enron's optimistic goal is probably reachable. The reason is that during the last decade, the cost of solar power generation has quietly declined by two-thirds. Far from depending on some wondrous breakthrough, the experts say, Enron can offer commercially competitive solar power by inexpensively mass-producing solar panels, and then employing thousands of them in the Nevada desert. Even the most optimistic supporters of solar power have doubted that they would see commercially competitive production until the next century. The Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group in Washington, said earlier this year that solar cell electricity, now as low as 20 cents a kilowatt-hour, might reach 10 cents by 2000 and 4 cents by 2020. Yet Enron is pledging to deliver the electricity at 5.5 cents a kilowatt- hour in about two years. That would beat the average cost of 5.8 cents currently paid by the Government for the electricity it uses. The national average retail price is 8 cents.]]></text>

Sprawling over three-quarters of her balcony is a $17,000 customized solar panel system (the cost was confirmed by a local company called Alternative Power, which worked with Jo to get the system installed) that produces half of the electricity she uses in her home. Jo is the pioneer of low-impact living in Manhattan, the first resident to connect a photovoltaic energy system to the city's electricity grid. Between planning and negotiating with her co-op board, it took Jo two years to get the system installed. ''The solar screens are an absolute expression of what I believe in,'' she beams.

In a series of papers published over the last few weeks in the journal Science and The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and in reports that will be presented at a meeting in Toronto in July, scientists are casting important new light on the strange protein fragment, known as beta amyloid, and how a few small errors in protein metabolism may spawn a chain reaction of cell death. Although some researchers reserve judgment, others predict the insights could result in new therapies against the disease.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[The latest work strongly suggests that the abnormal accretion of the protein fragments into stiff, rope-like patches throughout the brain is either a seminal event or one of the significant steps in the development of Alzheimer's. Many of the researchers believe that these amyloid plaques destroy the surrounding brain tissue, thereby contributing to memory loss, confusion and other hallmarks of the progressive dementia. Although researchers have known for some time that the plaques accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, they are now able to track the biochemical stages of their formation. They have gained new clues into the role of the normal protein from which amyloid pieces break off, and they are learning how the presence of just a few protein tatters in the brain may trigger production of beta-amyloid plaques]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[New studies indicate that normal amyloid protein is vital to orchestrating the growth of cells. In a recent issue of Science, investigators at the University of California at Irvine reported evidence that platelets in the blood may release one kind of the protein at the site of a wound to help stimulate cell division and inhibit the activity of degrading enzymes as part of tissue repair. And even newer studies indicate that another type of precursor protein may be able to spur the growth of neurons or their finger-like dendrites, although the results are fiercely debated. The beta-amyloid fragments result from a miscut in the normal clipping of the bigger amyloid protein during its release from cells. In a paper published in last month's Science, Dr. Sangram S. Sisodia, a molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore and his colleagues showed that, under ordinary circumstances, cells secrete about three-quarters of the precursor protein and clip it off in the middle of the final quarter. The shorn protein eventually is freed to perform its task outside the cell]]></text>

Microscopic balls of the protein beta amyloid accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and previous research showed that in the laboratory the protein was toxic to brain cells. But so far researchers have not been able to establish its exact role in the disease, and the latest findings, reported independently by four scientific laboratories, add to the mystery.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[More than four million Americans are believed to suffer from Alzheimer's, which can destroy the mind, memory and eventually the personality. The cause is unknown. There is no cure or treatment that can arrest progress of the disease. The main physical clue to the disorder is the presence of deposits of a protein called beta amyloid in the blood vessels and tissues of the brain. In the brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients, the amyloid forms the core of ball-shaped plaques. Aberrant and Abnormal Growth Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe of the Harvard Medical School said the new evidence suggests that Alzheimer's is not solely a degeneration of the brain, but partly a process of aberrant and abnormal growth. Evidence emerging in the past year indicates that amyloid deposition is the earliest stage of the disease.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[many researchers are asking if that old hypothesis is correct. They cite accumulating evidence that memory starts to fail long before brain cells die, and that the disease, with its memory loss, begins as an interruption of the signaling between living and healthy brain cells. If they are right, it may be possible to stop Alzheimer's, and reverse the memory loss, if treatments begin before brain cells die. The new idea is that the disease starts when small clumps of a protein, amyloid, start interrupting signals between nerve cells in the brain. The synapses, where one cell signals another in the brain's intricate circuitry, no longer function. Yet, at this early stage of the disease, researchers say, the nerve cells are still alive and well, and the disease might be halted if the clumps of amyloid could be removed or inactivated. But if the disease continues, brain cells start to die. Dead and dying cells accumulate in heaps in the brain, and the injured brain cannot be made whole.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Consider the consequences of a garbage strike. Trash accumulates, streets are clogged and daily life is disrupted. Eventually, things can come to a standstill. Scientists say that kind of disruption may lie at the heart of a wide array of diseases afflicting millions of Americans. In the brain, researchers say, the result is Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and a slew of other neurodegenerative disorders including the human version of mad cow disease. In the pancreas, it is Type 2 diabetes; in the lungs, cystic fibrosis; in the eyes, cataracts. If the problem develops in a certain blood protein, patients can develop numbness in the fingers or toes, or a mysterious form of heart disease that may affect as many as 4 percent of African-Americans. In these and other diseases, researchers say, there are problems with the body's cellular machinery for making proteins and recycling misshapen proteins. Misfolded proteins build up, like trash clogging an alleyway. Normally, our cellular machinery identifies misshapen proteins, reduces them to their constituent parts and recycles those parts. But when this process goes awry, small numbers of misfolded proteins accumulate into tiny spherical particles inside cells. These particles are so small and soluble that they had escaped detection until very recently, but many researchers now say they may be what actually harms brain cells in Alzheimer's disease and islet cells in Type 2 diabetes and so on. Only later and gradually, however, the spheres stick together, forming tiny rods filaments and much larger fibrils, which in turn accumulate into insoluble deposits of protein called amyloid plaque.]]></text>

The investigators, led by Dr. Leonard F. M. Scinto, of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, and by Dr. Huntington Potter, of Harvard Medical School, report that people with Alzheimer's appear to be exquisitely sensitive to eye drops similar to those that doctors use to dilate the pupils before performing an eye examination. They found that the pupils of people with Alzheimer's dilate in response to an atropine solution that is just one-hundredth the strength needed for dilation. Moreover, the researchers report, people with other brain diseases appear to respond normally to the eye drops. And, they say, they have preliminary evidence that people with Alzheimer's may test positive months before their symptoms become obvious.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[In a study reported last week in the British journal Nature, Dr. John Hardy and colleagues at St. Mary's Hospital in London found that Alzheimer's patients from two unrelated families had a mutation in a gene on chromosome 21 that directs cells to produce amyloid, a crucial nerve cell protein. The discovery indicates that an altered amyloid protein can cause some Alzheimer's cases, and so suggests that fragments of amyloid itself can kill brain cells. But the amyloid gene mutation is not the only cause of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have found that other families inherit the disease through a gene on chromosome 19. Dr. Alan Roses and his colleagues at the Duke University School of Medicine used genetic markers, landmarks on a chromosome, to find an association between Alzheimer's disease in some families and chromosome 19. Although the researchers have not yet homed in on the gene itself, they know it is different from the gene for amyloid because it is on a different chromosome.]]></text>

Scientists have discovered and cloned the gene for another protein, beta amyloid, which is a major component of the plaques that seem to clog the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Cloning the gene -reproducing it in the laboratory -makes possible detailed studies and complete analysis of the protein, possibly revealing its function. Potentially even more important, scientists have found the approximate location in the human genetic material of a gene that strongly predisposes to the brain disorder in some families. A high research priority is discovery of the gene itself. Analysis of the gene usually discloses the identity of the particular substance that cells make in carrying out the gene's instructions. Identifying such a substance linked to Alzheimer's disease might help reveal underlying causes.]]></text>

And the finding of the defect in Alzheimer's patients but not in healthy individuals indicates that amyloid protein is indeed a cause of the disease.

Two percent to 3 percent of the population has two genes for this variant, and some geneticists are speculating that many of these cases might be prevented, that is, aborted, by detecting this variant prenatally. Is 60 years of life of no value if Alzheimer's disease is the ultimate prospect? Some say not. Do you?]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[The news seemed breathtaking. An Alzheimer's vaccine that had previously worked in mice now seemed safe in patients. Many newspapers ran enthusiastic articles; some even put the news on their front pages, signaling that it was among the most important events of the day. Radio and television programs were even more upbeat, hinting strongly that help was on the way for the four million Americans with Alzheimer's. But the eager reporting raises difficult questions of what to say about medical advances and when to say it. The vaccine itself was exciting. But that news came a year ago in an article in the journal Nature. Scientists then reported they had injected mice with a protein that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and is thought to lead to the widespread death of brain cells, resulting in symptoms like loss of memory and of the ability to reason and think. Mice do not get the disease, but these animals had been genetically engineered to make large quantities of the aberrant protein, beta amyloid, which accumulated in their brains. When the scientists from Elan Pharmaceuticals in San Francisco gave mice the vaccine, the animals produced antibodies that blocked the accumulation of beta amyloid in their brains, and it even seemed to help clean up some that had already accumulated. It was, in a sense, proof of a principle illustrating that the immune system of mice, when properly primed, could attack the dangerous Alzheimer's proteins in the brain.]]></text>

The cells are neurons from the most highly evolved part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, the seat of human thought, memory and artistry. By getting the cells to flourish in the laboratory, researchers said, they can study the human brain in greater biochemical and genetic detail than was possible before. ''One of the great mysteries of the brain is how the highest centers function to allow us to think, remember and experience emotion,'' said Dr. Ira B. Black, a professor of neurology at Cornell University Medical College in New York who learned of the work at conferences. ''With this cell line we'll be able to ask questions that would be difficult or impossible to approach in humans or experimental animals.'' Scientists said the line of cells also offered a valuable tool for testing new drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and other disorders of the brain.]]></text>

The studies are being conducted in experimental chambers at NASA's Stennis Space Center at Bay St. Louis, Miss. Scientists say polluted rooms cannot be cleaned up by plants alone. No amount of greenery, for example, is likely to reduce the smoke and dust in a room. Even when plants do filter specific chemicals, they are much more effective in the sealed conditions of a space station than in a house or an apartment, where the effects of ventilation usually far outweigh those of plants. Still, the new studies indicate that well-chosen greenery can reduce the levels of some dangerous contaminants.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Reducing indoor air pollutants is a greater challenge, and there is a greater variety of devices to choose from, ranging from less than $50 to around $800. An air cleaner will not effectively remove radon, experts say. And the usefulness of air cleaners in removing such gases as formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide varies widely, according to a 1986 study by a Rodale Press magazine, New Shelter (since renamed Practical Homeowner). But the cleaners can draw airborne pollutant particles from the air. The basic components of air cleaners are a fan to draw in air and filtering devices that trap particles. Some units combine air cleaners with negative-ion generators. Extravagant medical claims have been associated with negative-ion generators. The charged ions the generators emit do, however, have a demonstrable benefit; they act like magnets on pollution particles. This makes such devices especially good at removing smoke from the air. Experts recommend units with fans. The experts' choice are devices that combine technologies for maximum efficacy. The Bionaire 1000, for example, combines an ion generator with an electrically charged filter. Others - like the King-Aire Freedom, the King-Aire Eliminator, the E. L. Foust Series 400 and the Cleanaire 150 by Air Techniques - combine carbon filters and top-of-the line filters made with glass fibers. An Electrical Trap Some experts prefer air cleaners that incorporates electrostatic precipitators, which charge incoming particles and trap them on plates with an opposite charge. An example is the Honeywell F59A. Even though some experts have found that air cleaners help asthmatics and others with allergies, manufacturers are not permitted to make health claims, according to Food and Drug Administration officials, because these devices have not been approved for such purposes. To be effective, air cleaners and ionizers must be of a size and a capacity that is proportionate to the space where they will be used. Air cleaners that are built into homes are the most effective.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Good ventilation can help alleviate the problem of indoor smoke, but many people who work in close quarters with smokers may wonder whether desk-top air cleaners work. The answer is ''partly,'' according to researchers who have tested air-cleaning systems at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California and at the John B. Pierce Foundation Laboratory, affiliated with Yale University. There are more than 3,800 types of particles and gases in cigarette smoke. Both labs found that electrostatic precipitators, which give the particles an electrical charge and then use that charge to attract them to an oppositely charged collection plate, were effective in removing some of the particles, but not the various gases in smoke. Air cleaners that draw cigarette smoke through a charcoal filter were more effective in trapping some of the gases. Consumer Reports, in 1985, and New Shelter magazine, in 1982, both tested portable air cleaners, and both gave the the Bionaire 1000 the top rating. The Bionaire is one of many ''ionizer'' air cleaners on the market. The ionizer models also charge particles, and, their makers say, the charge causes the particles to settle out of the atmosphere more quickly.]]></text>

Craig Potter, the Environmental Protection Agency's assistant administrator for air and radiation, told a Senate subcommittee holding hearings on the proposed legislation on indoor air quality that it would cost too much money and that it tried to do too much too soon. The program would cost about $60 million a year. In testimony before the Environmental Protection Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Potter said that his agency was dealing with the problem of indoor air contaminants and that existing legislation was adequate. Both Democratic and Republican members of the Senate panel quickly criticized Mr. Potter's testimony as another attempt by the Reagan Administration to obstruct environmental legislation. Some Senators suggested that the opposition came chiefly from the Office of Management and Budget rather than the environmental agency. Up to 6,000 Deaths Annually]]></text>

The current operating budget is almost 20 percent lower in real dollars than the 1981 budget, and President Reagan's proposed fiscal 1988 budget would actually cut E.P.A.'s current operating funds. The E.P.A. report identifies several environmental problems that pose a high risk but have received relatively little agency effort. In this category are indoor air pollution, global warming as a result of fossil fuel combustion, and destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer by man-made chemicals.

					<text><![CDATA[The problems of indoor air quality arose after the energy crisis of the 1970's and the drive for energy-efficient buildings. ''We then saw the construction of buildings that are basically jars,'' Mr. Sahn said. ''Tightly sealed buildings with windows that didn't open were expected to conserve energy. They put more pressure on the ventilation system to be the generator of the building and if that wasn't maintained properly, impure air traveled throughout a building, making it sick.'' Concerns about indoor air pollution, which has resulted in what is called ''sick building syndrome,'' have prompted Long Island architects to promote the awareness of new technology for clean indoor air and New York State to adopt a tax incentive to encourage the design of energy-efficient and environmentally safe -- or so-called green -- buildings. The ''green building credit'' against state income taxes was signed into law two years ago, but its implementation has been held up in ''a debate of final issues'' by the Department of Environmental Conservation, said Craig Kneeland, senior project manager for the state's Energy Research and Development Authority.]]></text>

The conditions can vary depending on body chemistry and the amount of exposure to chemicals, contaminated air or pesticides. What also happens, experts say, is that once victims have been afflicted -- even if their health improves -- exposure to certain chemicals or products can prompt a relapse even if the patients were not previously sensitive to them. Many cases are linked to ''sick building syndrome,'' which most commonly occurs in poorly ventilated buildings where formaldehyde gas is trapped after being released from new carpeting, glues or furniture. S.B.S. can also be caused by mold and mildew in air-conditioning. ''Nationwide, indoor air pollution costs tens of billions of dollars annually,'' wrote Nicholas Ashord and Claudia Miller in their book, ''Chemical Exposure'' (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1997). ''M.C.S. cases are part of this costly burden and exact a significant financial toll on patients, building owners and employers.'']]></text>

As a result, air tends to enter from the foundations of the building, bringing radon from the ground with it. Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that occurs naturally as a result of the decay of uranium in the soil and rocks. The gas produces radioactive particles that can lodge in the lung and cause lung cancer. Outdoors, radon dissipates and is relatively harmless. But inside some buildings, particularly airtight, poorly ventilated buildings, it can accumulate to concentrations that, over years of exposure, can raise the risk of lung cancer. Smoking adds substantially to the risk, the Public Health Service has warned.]]></text>

Although the strength of the evidence varies from one ailment to another, the report cites many alarming findings. The smoke inhaled by adult nonsmokers increases their risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 percent and lung cancer by 20 to 30 percent.

					<text><![CDATA[American officials played down the importance of the declaration, while acknowledging that they were surprised by the announcement; they and Asian officials had believed North Korea was about to return to the negotiating table after a hiatus of eight months. The officials said American intelligence agencies had for years worked on the assumption that the North probably possessed nuclear weapons. Just last week, two White House officials traveled to Asia with assessments that North Korea's arsenal had probably enlarged and with evidence that the country had probably sold partly processed nuclear fuel on the black market. In Washington, intelligence officials were scanning satellite imagery for any evidence that North Korea might be preparing a nuclear test, but so far have seen none, officials said.]]></text>

President Vladimir V.

At the same time, however, they have criticized proposals to impose economic or diplomatic penalties or to refer North Korea's defiance of international monitoring to the United Nations Security Council.]]></text>

It said it had completed reprocessing of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods that could provide enough plutonium for four to six additional weapons.]]></text>

It is unlikely that the United Nations will take meaningful action in this situation, since no power other than the United States possesses the means to back up words with action. Even if the administration's strategy of isolating North Korea works, at best it would amount to a partial tightening of sanctions against a country whose economy is already moribund. The only additional threat available is the denial of food aid for the people of North Korea, an act that would take the United States into new moral territory.]]></text>

Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned of 30 ''virtual new weapons states'' on the horizon. Obviously, the more countries that possess the bomb, the higher the risk of a nuclear accident, the theft of a weapon, sales of technology and hardware, and a serious miscalculation leading to nuclear war. So where should Mr. Ban start? With North Korea having declared after its test last October that it now possesses a nuclear deterrent, the understandable temptation will be to focus on Iran. This would be a mistake. North Korea is still some way off from having a reliable nuclear weapon, and to accept its having this capacity as a fait accompli would not only play into its game plan but also convince Iran and other countries that the international community lacks the will to prevent them from developing the bomb. A new approach is required. The logical place to look is to examine the lessons of ''nuclear reversal'' -- that is, what has made states in the past give up the nuclear option.]]></text>

That contention was amplified in Seoul on Monday by Chung Dong Young, South Korea's minister of unification, in a speech to the National Assembly in which he noted that the North had made similar claims at least 10 times since 2003.

					<text><![CDATA[North Korea said today that it had removed the equipment that international inspectors installed more than eight years ago to make sure that it would not make use of its large stockpile of plutonium to produce nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials said they feared that North Korea could use that plutonium to manufacture five or six nuclear weapons within months. The action, coming one day after North Korea took similar monitoring equipment off a nuclear reactor, intensifies the crisis over North Korea's nuclear capability, at a moment when President Bush has tried to focus the world's attention on the threat posed by Iraq. It also poses a challenge to the newly elected government in South Korea. [Page A12.]]]></text>

North Korea did not say when it would try to test a weapon, and experts inside and outside the Bush administration said the announcement itself was a negotiating ploy, intended to force the White House into lifting economic sanctions and holding one-on-one talks with North]]></text>

			<narrative>Relevant documents capture news stories covering the history of the abortion drug RU-486, known as mifepristone in the United States, from its development in France to approval  by the Food and Drug Administration for termination of early pregnancy. Despite considerable congressional opposition and efforts by anti-abortion groups, the drug was approved and has been used  by large numbers of women, although several have died from associated bacterial infections.

It is not used as a morning-after contraceptive pill but instead is taken to end an actual pregnancy up to seven weeks after the last menstrual period. Mifepristone would not completely replace surgical abortions in the United States, in part because it must be used so early in pregnancy. But it would make abortions more easily available, because it could be provided by doctors who are not trained to do surgical abortions, as long as they are near medical facilities where a surgical abortion could be performed if efforts at the drug-induced one failed.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[After sustained political pressure from the Clinton Administration, the French manufacturer of the controversial abortion pill RU-486 today announced an agreement that is expected to pave the way for the pill to be available to American women by 1996. The agreement calls for the manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, to turn over the pill's patent rights and all technology, free, to the Population Council, a nonprofit contraceptive research organization in New York. The council plans to find an American company to produce the pill, which can be used within seven weeks of conception to end a pregnancy; the group will also conduct clinical trials with 2,000 American women this fall.

Wade. Mifepristone's availability may in time not only make abortion more readily accessible to American women, but may also slowly and subtly alter the language in which abortion is debated politically.

But that promise has gone unfulfilled because of political controversies surrounding abortion and earlier difficulties in finding a suitable manufacturer. Now come troubling reports that the Food and Drug Administration, as it moves toward final approval of the drug it pronounced safe and effective in 1996, is considering unreasonable restrictions on the distribution of RU-486 that would virtually eliminate its chief value.]]></text>

But it is taking a lot more than a Presidential signature to get RU486, the French abortion-inducing pill, into this country. A promising start was made this week when an executive of Roussel-Uclaf, the drug's manufacturer, met with Dr. David Kessler, who heads the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The French company, Dr. Kessler said later, is finally willing to talk about making the drug available here -- presumably under an agreement with another company or research institution.

					<text><![CDATA[I've been told the cashew tree produces an apple that is technically not a fruit, and a nut that is technically not a nut. Botanically speaking, what is a fruit, what is a nut, and where does the bounty of the cashew tree fall? A. Botanically speaking, a fruit is the matured ovary of a seed-producing plant, including the seeds, their coating and anything immediately associated with them. A nut is harder to crack. Technically, a nut is a hard, one-celled, one-seeded fruit whose seed is enclosed in a woody or leathery coating, and it does not open when ripe. But some nuts, including walnuts, are ambiguous. Because their fleshy coatings split, they fall somewhere between true nuts and the kernels of stone fruits, like almonds, which (technically) are not nuts at all. But these are models of clarity compared with the cashew, Anacardium occidentale. In the cashew's case, the large, juicy, fleshy item, called an apple in spite of its decidedly pear shape, is technically a swollen peduncle, or stalk. At the end of the stalk, while it is still small and svelte, a flower grows. From the flower comes the cashew nut, which is technically the fruit of the tree. Once the fruit is formed, both it and the stalk start to swell, and by harvest time, the stalk is 8 to 10 times bigger than the fruit. There's not much to this so-called fruit except the sweet, meaty kernel we know as a cashew, but it does include a thin, hard shell and a clinging film of brown skin. These are both removed before the nut is marketed, and a good thing, too. The cashew is related to poison ivy, and the oils in its shell cause allergic reactions far worse than those inflicted by that odious vine.]]></text>

The place has a polish that reflects experience. Pleasant, muted colors recall the yellow-browns of coriander, before and after roasting and grinding. Walls, half-walls and a raised platform create separate and intimate spaces. The waterfall opposite the door supplies a soothing backdrop of sound. The food, under the direction of C. P. Bhandari, the chef, uses familiar ingredients -- yogurt, lamb, chicken, rice, lentils, peanuts -- combined in ways that might be novel to an American palate. The crab salad (nandu puttu), though highly spiced, was considerably more interesting than the ubiquitous crab cake. It juxtaposed the yielding flesh with the crunch of cashew]]></text>

The extensive menu includes the usual hit parade of samosas, curries, tandoori treats and even mulligatawny soup. But it also includes some sleepers like chutney idli, a small cake of steamed lentil and rice flour topped with a coconut curry. Spicier and just as good is kadhi pakoda, another appetizer. Balls of cumin-spiced lentil flour are deep-fried and served with a mustard-flavor yogurt sauce. I found the lamb to be tough in the several dishes I tried, like achari lamb and lamb xacutti (pronounced ESH-uh-coo-tee). Chicken, on the other hand, was unfailingly moist, tender and flavorful, especially the chicken Nizami, a masala dish with cashews]]></text>

Pierce the chicken pieces all over with a fork. Put them in a dish and squeeze a lime over them and season them with salt. Set aside. Put all the ingredients except the potatoes and the coriander leaves for the marsala in a blender or food processor and process until a fine paste forms. Spread this marsala all over the chicken pieces and set aside to marinate for at least two hours at room temperature. 2. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the chicken pieces and fry them for 10 to 12 minutes, turning until the skin is dark brown and crispy and the juices run clear when each piece is pricked with the tip of a knife. Turn over the pieces several times while they are frying. 3. Halfway through the cooking process, arrange the potatoes in a ring around the chicken so they fry with the chicken. If there is not enough room, they can be fried in the fat remaining in the pan after the chicken is removed and kept warm. Serve with the potatoes arranged around the chicken and garnish with coriander leaves. Yield: 4 servings.

					<text><![CDATA[Origin Thai Inc. is a 55-seat restaurant occupying a old storefront that blends in to the mostly deserted evening streetscape -- except for the steady stream of diners headed in looking hungry and leaving looking happy. Good signs, since on my first visit I am courting trouble by taking Thai-foodie friends to a place I hadn't scouted. Inside, it's loud, with sounds bouncing way up to the old tin ceiling, past the pair of 1904 Coast Guard oars and back down, blending conversations with the clatter of clearing dishes and clinking glasses and making a chat with the host an intimate affair. We settle in with menus, lifting our eyes long enough to note -- and covet -- platters going to other diners. We order. We wait. We speculate. I hope that the food is as good as it looks, that there is substance to these elegant, artistic plates. Finally, some of those beautiful platters begin arriving at our table. With every bite, my hopes rise, because the appetizers and the salads are excellent. Fragrant little curls of steam rise from a pyramid of grilled squid, the white flesh only slightly overcooked and still a tasty complement to the cool mix of baby greens, diced mangoes, tomatoes and shallots spiked with basil, mint, fish sauce, chili peppers, lemon juice and tamarind. The caramelized quail is succulent and sweet, its tenderness a match for the sweet snow peas in an orange vinaigrette. Mr. Sutipayakul treats the soft-shell crab with respect, frying it fast and serving it hot between layers of cooling ginger, green mango and cashews.]]></text>

An order of lad nha seafood featured a bed of large, flat noodles topped by broccoli julienne, shrimp and squid. The dark horse of the noodle dishes, though, was pad khi mao, based on flat, transparent mung bean noodles, just a tad spicy, with vegetables and basil. For this, we chose beef, but the friend who recommended the dish swears by shrimp. Your call. Among the many savory entrées, the hands-down winner was kang panang. Shrimp made a pleasing choice for this yellow panang curry and exquisitely complex, mildly spicy-sweet sauce. Rich, heavy coconut milk acted as the vehicle for a perfectly balanced seasoning that included coriander, lemon grass, chili and lime. Chicken with cashews (pahd cashew nut)]]></text>

With a plastic grape arbor hanging near the kitchen, more grapes painted on imitation stained-glass windows, and a small plastic panel of a blue sky, its oddball interior lacks Congee Village's stylish evocation of life in a hamlet. But the food is fresh and vivid, with clear spicing and pure flavors. Of course, I'm disposed toward congee ($2 to $7.75), but even so, Congee's is outstanding. It arrives bubbling in a crock, smelling of ginger and lemon. I especially liked it with slivers of savory pork and bits of pungent preserved egg, or with black mushrooms and velvety slices of chicken breast, and I liked a shot of hot sauce in it as well. If your soul does not cry out for congee, the restaurant offers many other superb dishes, with none better than deep-fried golden-skinned chicken, chopped into manageable pieces and topped with plenty of chopped garlic and scallions ($9 half, $18 whole). Under the crisp exterior the flesh is juicy and rich, exhibit No. 1 in the case against boring chicken dishes. Squab with soy sauce ($13.95) presents a different side of poultry, but makes a similar point. The small bird, lacquered and shiny, has an almost liver-like flavor that is a welcome antidote to the more typically bland squabs and quails. I loved salt-baked squid with cashews]]></text>

In addition, the garlicky black bean sauce obliterated the delicate lobster flavor. Three courses each for three people came to $42.65, with tax and tip extra. Magic Wok has no liquor license but does provide an unlimited supply of excellent jasmine tea. The legerdemain in this ''magic wok'' is its ability to produce a wide range of acceptable Chinese specialties]]></text>

Pongal is a nice place to eat with a group of four or more, so that you can sample an assortment of dishes. Appetizers ought to include iddly, steamed cakes of lentils and rice that arrive in rasam ($4.95), a spicy lentil broth, or in sambar ($3.95), a chunky soup that is a little less spicy than the rasam. Both go well with dosai podi ($1.25), a peppery sauce also known as red gunpowder. Vada, crisp, spicy doughnuts made with lentil flour, make a nice counterpoint to the iddly. They also come with rasam ($4.95) and sambar ($3.95). Dahi vada ($4.95), lentil balls in a spicy yogurt sauce, is a mouthful of contrasts. The yogurt is cooling and refreshing, yet the peppery edge sets the mouth aglow. It goes beautifully with the accompanying coconut chutney. Spinach pakoda ($3.95), fritters of spinach and chickpea flour, are savory, while masala cashew nuts]]></text>

Eating your way through all this food would take a long while; I look forward to the challenge. The appetizers are especially appealing. I loved Mysore masala dosai, a crisp crepe so large the ends hang off the plate. Folded inside is a delightful mixture of spicy potatoes and hot chutney. Accompanied by a fragrant bowl of spiced lentils and a breathtaking coconut chutney, it makes a perfect little meal.

					<text><![CDATA[Northern India with unique skill, balancing the myriad flavors so well that each taste plays and teases briefly on the tongue before merging into a delicious whole. The restaurant's décor is hardly impressive. There is a cold hollowness in its unadorned walls and a ceiling so high that one can easily overlook two crystal chandeliers, an odd match for bare pine tables better suited to a cozy log cabin. But what the restaurant lacks in ambience it makes up for with some mighty gorgeous food. In the cooking style of the region, tandoori or clay oven roasting is frequently used -- providing a delicious alternative to the saucy curries, which were rich and lovely and veered toward the aromatic rather than the spicy hot. Vegetable dishes and breads were also notable. A flaky samosa filled with mildly seasoned potato and pea filling made a sturdy starter, as did a mix of boneless chicken, mint and cilantro. It's a good idea to order breads along with appetizers. (Rice comes with the entrees.) Although they can be ordered individually, we opted for the basket, which holds an excellent assortment of onion kulcha and fluffy, buttery paratha and is covered by a long, supple ''tongue'' of nan. The menu offers cutlery on request, although it's already on the table. Traditionally, pieces of pliant bread are used to scoop curries, and fingers serve for large pieces of meat. An appetizer portion of tandoori shrimp arrived with four juicy jumbos, marinated and spicy hot. Two thin rolls of minced vegetable kebabs were mild yet flavorful. But the pickled, roasted mushrooms could be an acquired taste, and potatoes stuffed with raisins and cashews]]></text>

The center of the chop is ideally tender, moist and pink while the marinade outside is cooked into a silky cloak that's one with the meat itself. The scant flesh running the length of the rib is transformed into charred lamb candy, the bones begging to be gnawed clean. The lamb, like all the tandoori dishes and curries, is accompanied by fragrant, fluffy and perfectly cooked basmati rice. Mr. Xalxo says he prepares the rice from a recipe that includes doses of cumin, ginger and garlic. The best dinner one could have at Earthen Oven would include the lamb chops and the accompanying rice; one of the tandoori flatbreads (the rosemary nan is the least exciting of the bunch; the onion kulcha, with its appealing juxtaposition of sweet cooked onions and black tandoori char, is the best); the supremely rich black lentil dal named after Mr. Prasad ($11.95); and a curry from Mr. Xalxo's side of the kitchen.

Try goenchi dal ani batata bhaji, which mates lentils with potatoes or the assortment called ''boss's vegetables.'' Incidentally, sharing an entree can carry a charge of $5, sometimes waived when a meal begins with an appetizer course. Ask. An acquired taste, saanas (like idli), a steamed rice bread, took its texture from the addition of shredded coconut; the baked flat wheat bread called chappatti was nicely buttery and soft. But rice is the carbohydrate of the south, making breads unnecessary. Condiments serve to refresh the palate, and quite a few pickles and relishes are available. We enjoyed tindli pickle and mango chutney, always a winner. After a meal of such assertive flavors, sweet things contrasted nicely, and some of the desserts here were dandy, like ice creams (mango, fabulous cinnamon, rare cashew]]></text>

When news of San Miguel's successes spread, the owner of a Filipino stuffed-toy firm, BMR Industries, offered to hire the women as subcontractors. Within three months, 300 people were producing stuffed toys. Not long afterward, BMR's main factory and warehouse were flooded, and the company suspended operations. Undaunted, the women of San Miguel exported the toys themselves. With a $100,000 loan from the state Technology and Livelihood Resource Center, they bought materials from Taiwan and sold the finished product to Dan-Dee, which distributes to American stores like K Mart and J. C.Penney. ''The women of San Miguel are ready to produce 100,000 dozen toys a month, but don't have enough capital,'' Sylvia Munoz-Ordonez, the director of the Filipino women's foundation, recently told a representative from the United Nations development fund for women. She said she hoped the fund would help finance a new project converting the household sewing centers into centrally managed production centers, which would provide 1,000 workers with an average yearly income of $1,870. The women's latest undertaking is what they call the greening of San Miguel. Reinvesting half of their nearly $48,000 savings from stuffed toys, they purchased 112 acres to plant trees yielding mangoes, soursops, and cashews.]]></text>

The random attacks of the disease have made it hard to pinpoint just which spirits are angry, he said. One shaman told the people of Ping that they were being punished for felling sacred trees. Another told the family of a 16-year-old girl named Mel -- one of the first to die -- that she was being punished for having a sexual affair.

			<narrative>Both rebel groups need to be mentioned in the same document, but a simple mention doesn't always imply relevance. Some statement of comparison must be present. Differences in the groups' sizes, political philosophies, tactics, and areas of operation are relevant. Similarities in tactics and treatment by authorities are relevant. Rivalries and clashes between the two groups are also of interest.</narrative>
