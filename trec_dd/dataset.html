                The dataset used for TREC 2017 Dynamic Domain Track consists of two domains: Ebola and New York Times.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Ebola dataset is crawled by Juliana Friere (NYU, juliana dot freire at nyu dot edu), Kien Pham(NYU),
                Peter Landwehr (Giant Oak, peter dot landwehr at giantoak dot com) and Lewis McGibbney (JPL, Lewis dot J
                dot Mcgibbney at jpl dor nasa dot gov).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Ebola dataset contains records related to the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014-2015.
                The original dataset includes tweets relating to the outbreak, web pages from sites hosted in the
                affected countries as well as PDF documents from websites such as World Health Organization,
                Financial Tracking Service and The World Bank.
                Such information resources are designed to provide information to citizens and aid workers on the ground.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The New York Times dataset is published by Evan Sandhaus in 2008 under LDC Catalog No.
                <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2008t19">LDC2008T19</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The New York Times dataset consists of articles published in New York Times from January 1, 1987
                to June 19, 2007 with metadata provided by the New York Times Newsroom, the New York Times Indexing Service
                and the online production staff at nytimes.com. Most articles are manually summarized and tagged by professional staffs.
                The original form of this dataset is in
                <a href="https://iptc.org/standards/nitf/">News Industry Text Format (NITF)</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The details of these two datasets are shown in Table 1.

                            the actual tweets. The output of that crawler includes both the HTML pages from Twitter, as
                            well as extracted tweet data in the 'features' block.

                            CommonCrawlDataDumper dumps out the files and serialize them with CBOR encoding, a data

                The documents in each dataset are stored in a structured format called the Common Crawl Architecture

                the timestamp, and the source URL. They should also have an 'indices.key=crawl' field indicating which
